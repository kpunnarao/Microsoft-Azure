# Lab Guide: Understanding and Configuring Azure ExpressRoute (Conceptual): üåê

* **Conceptual vs. Real-world Lab**: a full ExpressRoute setup requires an active circuit from a connectivity provider. Therefore, a lab environment will focus on the Azure-side configuration steps and will be largely conceptual. The lab will guide the user on *what* they would do, rather than having them perform a live connection test.

* **Key Components**: Following are the core components:
    
    * **ExpressRoute Circuit**: The central object that represents the private connection. The lab will show how to create this, choose a `Service Provider`, `Peering Location`, `Bandwidth`, and `SKU` (`Standard` or `Premium`). It also highlights that the circuit is billed from the moment the `Service Key` is issued.
    
    * **Virtual Network Gateway**: The on-ramp into the Azure VNet for the ExpressRoute connection. The lab emphasize that this gateway type is `ExpressRoute`, not `VPN`, and requires a dedicated `GatewaySubnet` of at least `/27`.
    
    * **Connection**: The object that links the ExpressRoute Virtual Network Gateway to the ExpressRoute Circuit. The lab explain how to create this link and mention the use of an `Authorization key` for cross-subscription connections.

* **Command-line and Portal Instructions**: The results provide specific and up-to-date Azure CLI and PowerShell commands for each step: `az network express-route create`, `az network express-route peering create`, and `az network vnet-gateway create` (with `--gateway-type ExpressRoute`).

* **Important Caveats**: Following are few important poitns:
    
    * The long deployment time of the ExpressRoute Gateway (up to 45 minutes).
    
    * The importance of the `GatewaySubnet` name (`GatewaySubnet`) and size (`/27` or larger).
    
    * The fact that the `Service Key` is needed to provision the circuit with the connectivity provider.
    
    * The shared responsibility model with the service provider for the physical circuit.

* **Cleanup Steps**: The lab provide the correct order for deleting resources: delete the connection first, then the gateway, and finally the circuit. It also mentions that the circuit must be de-provisioned by the provider to stop billing.

This lab will guide you through the process of configuring Azure ExpressRoute, a crucial service for private, high-speed connectivity between your on-premises network and Azure. 

Since ExpressRoute relies on a physical circuit from a connectivity provider, this lab will be a conceptual walk-through, focusing on the steps you would take within Azure. 

You will not perform a live connection, but you will learn how to set up the necessary components on the Azure side.

## Lab Scenario üß™

Your organization has decided to use Azure ExpressRoute for a dedicated and private connection from its on-premises data center to Azure. 

This connection will provide higher bandwidth and lower latency than a site-to-site VPN. 

You have a meeting with your networking team and the connectivity provider to get started, and your task is to understand and prepare the Azure side of the configuration.

**Your specific objectives for this conceptual lab are:**

* Understand the key components of an ExpressRoute deployment.

* "Create" a conceptual ExpressRoute circuit in Azure.

* "Create" an ExpressRoute-specific Virtual Network Gateway.

* "Link" the gateway to the circuit.

* Understand the billing and service key concepts.

* Learn the proper cleanup procedure for ExpressRoute resources.

## Part 1: Prerequisites

* An active Azure subscription.

* **Existing VNet and VM**: You will use a VNet (e.g., `vnet-lab` with address space `10.0.0.0/16`) and a VM (e.g., `vm-app-01`) from previous labs.

* **GatewaySubnet**: Your `vnet-lab` should have a `GatewaySubnet` of at least `/27` from the VPN Gateway lab.

* **Azure Cloud Shell / Azure CLI / Azure PowerShell**: For managing Azure resources.

* **A note on pricing**: ExpressRoute is a high-cost service. Creating a circuit object will incur charges as soon as the service key is issued. **You should not perform the final creation steps in this lab unless you intend to pay for the service.** This lab is designed to be a conceptual exercise to prevent unexpected charges.

## Part 3: Step-by-Step Configuration (Conceptual)

### 3.1 Create an ExpressRoute Circuit

This is the first step on the Azure side. You would create a circuit resource that represents your physical connection.

#### 3.1.1 Using Azure Portal

1.  In the Azure Portal, search for `ExpressRoute circuits` and select it.
2.  Click **+ Create** and fill in the details. **Do not click Create yet.**
      * **Subscription**: Your subscription.
      * **Resource Group**: `rg-network-lab`.
      * **Region**: The region of your VNet (e.g., East US).
      * **Name**: `er-lab-circuit`.
      * **Port type**: `Provider`.
      * **Service Provider**: Select a provider (e.g., `Equinix`).
      * **Peering Location**: Select a location (e.g., `Silicon Valley`).
      * **Bandwidth**: Choose a bandwidth (e.g., `50 Mbps`).
      * **SKU**: `Standard`.
      * **Billing Model**: `Metered` or `Unlimited`.
3.  Click **Review + create** to see the summary, but **do not click Create**. This step generates the `Service Key` and starts billing.

#### 3.1.2 Using Azure CLI

```bash
# Define variables (for conceptual understanding only)
RESOURCE_GROUP="rg-network-lab"
CIRCUIT_NAME="er-lab-circuit"
LOCATION="eastus"
PROVIDER="Equinix" # Change to a real provider from `az network express-route list-service-providers`
PEERING_LOCATION="Silicon Valley"
BANDWIDTH=50
SKU="Standard"
SKU_FAMILY="MeteredData"

echo "Command to create the circuit (DO NOT RUN this command in a live environment without a provider agreement!)"
# az network express-route create --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
#   --name $CIRCUIT_NAME \
#   --location $LOCATION \
#   --provider $PROVIDER \
#   --peering-location "$PEERING_LOCATION" \
#   --bandwidth $BANDWIDTH \
#   --sku-family $SKU_FAMILY \
#   --sku-tier $SKU
```

**Conceptual Takeaway**: Once this circuit is created, you would take its `Service Key` (a unique GUID) and provide it to your connectivity provider. They use this key to provision the physical connection. The circuit status would remain `Not-Provisioned` until they complete their work.

### 3.2 Deploy an ExpressRoute Virtual Network Gateway

This gateway is a dedicated resource that handles the traffic from the ExpressRoute circuit into your VNet.

#### 3.2.1 Using Azure Portal

1.  Search for `Virtual network gateways` and click **+ Create**.
2.  Fill in the details:
      * **Gateway type**: Select **ExpressRoute**.
      * **VPN type**: N/A (this is automatically hidden).
      * **SKU**: `Standard` (The SKU determines throughput).
      * **Generation**: `Generation1`.
      * **Virtual network**: Select your `vnet-lab`.
      * **Public IP address**: Select **Create new** and name it `er-gateway-pip`.
3.  Click **Create**. This deployment will take time to provision.

#### 3.2.2 Using Azure CLI

```bash
# Define variables
RESOURCE_GROUP="rg-network-lab"
VNET_NAME="vnet-lab"
GATEWAY_NAME="er-vnet-gateway"
LOCATION="eastus"
PUBLIC_IP_NAME="er-gateway-pip"
GATEWAY_SUBNET_ID=$(az network vnet subnet show -g $RESOURCE_GROUP -n "GatewaySubnet" --vnet-name $VNET_NAME --query id -o tsv)

echo "Creating the ExpressRoute Virtual Network Gateway..."
az network public-ip create -g $RESOURCE_GROUP -n $PUBLIC_IP_NAME --allocation-method Dynamic --sku Basic
az network vnet-gateway create \
  --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
  --name $GATEWAY_NAME \
  --location $LOCATION \
  --gateway-type ExpressRoute \
  --sku Standard \
  --gateway-ip-configs name="ipconfig1" public-ip-address=$PUBLIC_IP_NAME subnet=$GATEWAY_SUBNET_ID \
  --output tsv
```

### 3.3 Link the VNet Gateway to the Circuit

This is the final step on the Azure side, creating the logical connection between the gateway and the circuit.

#### 3.3.1 Using Azure Portal

1.  Navigate to your `er-lab-circuit` ExpressRoute circuit.
2.  Under **Settings**, click **Connections**.
3.  Click **+ Add**.
4.  **Name**: `vnet-link`.
5.  **Virtual network gateway**: Select your `er-vnet-gateway` from the dropdown.
6.  Click **OK**.

#### 3.3.2 Using Azure CLI

```bash
# Define variables
RESOURCE_GROUP="rg-network-lab"
CIRCUIT_NAME="er-lab-circuit"
GATEWAY_NAME="er-vnet-gateway"

echo "Linking the ExpressRoute gateway to the circuit..."
az network express-route connection create \
  --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
  --name "vnet-link" \
  --express-route-gateway-name $GATEWAY_NAME \
  --circuit-name $CIRCUIT_NAME \
  --authorization-key <authorization-key-if-needed> \
  --output tsv
```

**Conceptual Takeaway**: Once this connection is created and the physical circuit is provisioned, BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) will be established between Azure and your on-premises routers. Your Azure VNet's resources will now have a private, high-bandwidth path to your on-premises network.

## Part 4: Cleanup Resources (Conceptual and Real)

This is a critical section for ExpressRoute. Deleting resources must be done in a specific order to avoid being charged.

1.  **Delete the connection**: First, you must delete the connection object that links the gateway to the circuit.
2.  **Delete the VNet Gateway**: Next, delete the ExpressRoute Virtual Network Gateway.
3.  **De-provision the circuit**: You must work with your connectivity provider to **de-provision** the physical circuit. They will release the resource on their end.
4.  **Delete the ExpressRoute Circuit**: Once the provider has de-provisioned the circuit, you can delete the ExpressRoute circuit resource from your Azure subscription.

**Warning**: If you fail to perform step 3, you will continue to be billed for the circuit, even if it is not linked to any gateways.

Congratulations\! You have successfully completed the conceptual configuration of Azure ExpressRoute, understanding its core components and the critical steps required for a successful hybrid cloud deployment. 

This knowledge is essential for architecting high-performance, private connectivity solutions with Azure.
