# üåê Section 2: Architecting the Digital Backbone - Hands-On Labs

## Introduction to Azure Networking in Practice

Welcome to the **Hands-On Labs** for Section 2: Architecting the Digital Backbone! In this module, you will move beyond theory and get practical experience with designing, implementing, and securing the fundamental networking components within Microsoft Azure. Networking is truly the "digital backbone" of any cloud solution, enabling communication and ensuring security.

These labs are meticulously designed to provide you with direct, step-by-step experience in configuring Azure Virtual Networks, applying network security groups, establishing connectivity between networks, and routing traffic effectively. By completing these exercises, you will not only understand the concepts but also gain the confidence to build robust and scalable network architectures for your cloud deployments.

### What You Will Achieve in These Labs:

Through the hands-on labs in this section, you will gain practical experience in:

1.  **Azure Virtual Network (VNet) Configuration:**
    * Creating Virtual Networks with appropriate address spaces and segmenting them into subnets.
    * Understanding the impact of CIDR notation on VNet and subnet sizing.
2.  **Network Security Group (NSG) Implementation:**
    * Creating and configuring Network Security Groups to control inbound and outbound traffic.
    * Applying NSGs to both subnets and individual Network Interfaces (NICs).
    * Practicing the creation of security rules for specific ports, protocols, and IP ranges.
3.  **VNet Peering:**
    * Establishing VNet Peering connections between two virtual networks within the same region.
    * Testing connectivity across peered networks.
    * Understanding scenarios for global VNet peering (conceptual/demonstrative).
4.  **Hybrid Connectivity with VPN Gateway:**
    * Setting up a basic Azure VPN Gateway.
    * Configuring a Point-to-Site VPN connection to securely connect your local machine to an Azure VNet.
    * (Optional/Demonstrative) Simulating a Site-to-Site VPN connection between two Azure VNets for a simplified hybrid scenario.
5.  **Basic Load Balancing:**
    * Deploying and configuring an Azure Load Balancer (Standard SKU) to distribute incoming traffic across multiple backend virtual machines.
    * Setting up backend pools, health probes, and load balancing rules.
6.  **Azure DNS Configuration:**
    * Creating and managing Public DNS Zones in Azure DNS.
    * Adding various record types (A, CNAME) to map custom domain names to Azure resources.
    * (Optional) Configuring an Azure DNS Private Zone for private VNet resolution.
7.  **Basic Network Troubleshooting (using Portal/CLI):**
    * Using basic portal tools or CLI commands to verify network connectivity and rule application.

### How These Labs Build Your Expertise:

These hands-on networking labs are absolutely fundamental for your development as an Azure Solutions Architect. They will enable you to:

* **Implement Secure Network Topologies:** Directly apply security principles by segmenting networks and controlling traffic flow with NSGs.
* **Design for Connectivity:** Gain practical skills in connecting various components within Azure and linking your cloud environment to on-premises resources.
* **Ensure High Availability & Scalability:** Understand how load balancing and VNet peering contribute to resilient and scalable network designs.
* **Problem-Solve Networking Issues:** Begin to develop intuition for network configuration and troubleshoot common connectivity problems.
* **Translate Theory to Practice:** Bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge of IP addressing, routing, and security, and their practical application in Azure.

Approach these labs with precision and attention to detail. Every network configuration decision is critical for the overall stability and security of your cloud solution. Mastering networking is a cornerstone of becoming an expert architect!
