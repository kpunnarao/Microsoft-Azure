## Introduction to Azure Compute in Practice

Welcome to the **Hands-On Labs** for Section 3: Powering Your Solutions! This module is where you'll get practical experience with the diverse range of compute services that host your applications in Azure. From traditional Virtual Machines to modern containerization and serverless functions, selecting and configuring the right compute platform is a foundational skill for an Azure Solutions Architect.

These labs are designed to give you direct, step-by-step experience in deploying, managing, and scaling various compute resources. You will learn to provision virtual machines, host web applications using Azure App Service, deploy containers, and even explore the basics of serverless computing. By actively engaging with these exercises, you will solidify your understanding of compute paradigms and build the practical skills necessary for designing robust and efficient application hosting solutions.

### What You Will Achieve in These Labs:

Through the hands-on labs in this section, you will gain practical experience in:

1.  **Azure Virtual Machine (VM) Deployment & Management:**
    * Creating and configuring Windows and Linux Virtual Machines in a VNet.
    * Managing VM disks (adding data disks, understanding OS vs. Data disks).
    * Connecting to Windows VMs via RDP and Linux VMs via SSH.
    * Understanding and implementing **Availability Sets** for basic VM redundancy.
    * (Optional/Demonstrative) Deploying VMs across **Availability Zones** for regional resilience.
    * Exploring VM sizing and pricing impacts through the Azure Portal.
2.  **Azure App Service - Web App Hosting:**
    * Creating an Azure App Service Plan and deploying a basic web application (e.g., from a code repository like GitHub or a sample application).
    * Configuring **Deployment Slots** for staging and production environments and practicing a swap operation.
    * Mapping a custom domain to your Azure Web App (conceptual setup/prerequisites).
    * Basic monitoring of App Service metrics in the Azure Portal.
3.  **Containerization with Azure:**
    * Building a simple Docker image (conceptual/using a pre-built one).
    * Deploying a containerized application to **Azure Container Instances (ACI)** for rapid deployment.
    * (Optional) Pushing a custom image to **Azure Container Registry (ACR)**.
    * (Conceptual/Demonstrative) Exploring the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) dashboard for a brief overview of cluster components.
4.  **Azure Functions - Serverless Computing Basics:**
    * Creating a basic HTTP-triggered Azure Function.
    * Testing the function and understanding its serverless execution model.
    * (Optional) Integrating the Function with a simple Azure Storage Queue trigger or output binding.

### How These Labs Build Your Expertise:

These hands-on compute labs are crucial for your development as an Azure Solutions Architect. They will enable you to:

* **Deploy Diverse Workloads:** Gain proficiency in deploying applications across different compute paradigms, from IaaS (VMs) to PaaS (App Service) and serverless (Functions).
* **Design for Scalability & Availability:** Understand and implement mechanisms like Availability Sets and App Service scaling to ensure your applications are highly available and can handle varying loads.
* **Make Platform Choices:** Develop an intuitive understanding of when to choose one compute service over another based on practical experience with their setup and capabilities.
* **Troubleshoot Application Hosting:** Begin to diagnose common deployment and runtime issues related to application hosting.
* **Translate Theory to Practice:** Directly apply concepts learned about VM types, app service plans, and container orchestration in a live Azure environment.

Engage actively with these labs. The more you build and configure, the stronger your understanding of Azure's compute capabilities will become, which is a core skill for designing scalable and reliable cloud solutions.
