# ðŸ”— Section 11: Connecting the Ecosystem - Hands-On Labs

## Introduction to Integration, Messaging, and DevOps in Practice

Welcome to the **Hands-On Labs** for Section 11: Connecting the Ecosystem! This module is dedicated to providing you with practical experience in integrating disparate systems, implementing asynchronous communication patterns, and applying core DevOps principles for efficient software delivery in Azure. As an Azure Solutions Architect, you will frequently design solutions that require seamless communication between services and rapid, reliable deployment cycles.

These labs are meticulously designed to give you direct, step-by-step experience with Azure Logic Apps for workflow orchestration, API Management for governing your APIs, and messaging services like Event Grid, Event Hubs, and Service Bus for building decoupled architectures. Furthermore, you will get hands-on with Azure DevOps to set up Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) pipelines. By actively engaging with these exercises, you will solidify your understanding of integration, messaging, and DevOps best practices and build the practical skills necessary for designing agile, interconnected, and continuously delivered cloud solutions.

### What You Will Achieve in These Labs:

Through the hands-on labs in this section, you will gain practical experience in:

1.  **Azure Logic Apps - Workflow Automation:**
    * Creating a basic **Consumption Logic App** with an HTTP Request trigger.
    * Adding actions to connect to another Azure service (e.g., sending an email via Office 365 Outlook connector, or writing to an Azure Storage Queue).
    * (Optional) Building a simple scheduled Logic App to automate a periodic task.
    * Monitoring Logic App runs and troubleshooting failures.
2.  **Azure API Management (APIM) - Exposing & Securing APIs:**
    * Deploying an **Azure API Management instance** (Developer tier for cost-effectiveness).
    * Importing a sample API (e.g., from an Azure Function App or a public API like Pet Store).
    * Applying a basic **policy** to the API (e.g., a rate limit policy or a CORS policy).
    * Testing the API through the APIM developer portal.
    * (Optional) Configuring an API to use a **Managed Identity** for backend authentication.
3.  **Azure Messaging Services - Decoupling Components:**
    * **Azure Event Grid:**
        * Creating a custom **Event Grid Topic**.
        * Creating an **Event Grid Subscription** to route events from the custom topic to an Azure Function or Logic App.
        * Publishing a test event to the custom topic and observing the function/logic app execution.
    * **Azure Service Bus:**
        * Creating a **Service Bus Namespace** and a **Queue**.
        * Sending messages to the queue and receiving messages from it using a simple console application or Azure Portal tools.
        * (Optional) Creating a **Topic with Subscriptions** and demonstrating publish-subscribe messaging.
    * **Azure Event Hubs (Conceptual/Basic Send):**
        * (Conceptual/Demonstrative) Creating an **Event Hubs Namespace** and an **Event Hub**.
        * Using a simple tool or script to send messages to the Event Hub to understand data ingestion.
4.  **Azure DevOps - Basic CI/CD Pipeline:**
    * Creating an **Azure DevOps organization and project**.
    * Setting up an **Azure Repos Git repository** and committing a simple application code (e.g., a basic .NET Core or Node.js web app).
    * Creating an **Azure Pipeline (YAML-based recommended)** for **Continuous Integration (CI)**:
        * Building the application code.
        * Running automated tests (if simple tests are available).
        * Publishing build artifacts.
    * Extending the CI pipeline (or creating a separate **Release Pipeline**) for **Continuous Delivery (CD)**:
        * Deploying the application artifact to an Azure App Service (from Section 3).
        * Understanding release stages and environment approvals.

### How These Labs Build Your Expertise:

These hands-on integration, messaging, and DevOps labs are fundamental for your development as an Azure Solutions Architect. They will enable you to:

* **Design Interconnected Systems:** Gain practical experience in building workflows and managing APIs to integrate services seamlessly.
* **Architect for Scalability & Resilience:** Understand how asynchronous messaging patterns decouple components, improving the robustness and scalability of your applications.
* **Automate Software Delivery:** Master the basics of CI/CD pipelines to enable rapid, reliable, and automated deployments of your solutions.
* **Choose the Right Messaging Service:** Develop an intuitive understanding of when to use Event Grid, Event Hubs, or Service Bus based on practical scenarios.
* **Streamline API Management:** Learn how to govern, secure, and publish APIs effectively using API Management.
* **Translate Theory to Practice:** Directly apply concepts learned about integration patterns, messaging queues, and automated deployments in a live Azure environment.

Approach these labs with a focus on flow and automation. Mastering these areas will enable you to design and deliver modern, agile, and robust cloud solutions.
