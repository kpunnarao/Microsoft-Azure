# üóÑÔ∏è Section 5: Powering Data-Driven Solutions - Hands-On Labs

## Introduction to Database Architecture in Practice

Welcome to the **Hands-On Labs** for Section 5: Powering Data-Driven Solutions! This module is where you'll get practical experience with deploying, configuring, and interacting with Azure's rich ecosystem of managed database services. As an Azure Solutions Architect, choosing the right database, ensuring its performance, scalability, and security, and integrating it effectively into your application architecture are paramount skills.

These labs are meticulously designed to give you direct, step-by-step experience with relational databases like Azure SQL Database, NoSQL databases like Azure Cosmos DB, and managed open-source options. You will also explore caching solutions to enhance application performance. By actively engaging with these exercises, you will solidify your understanding of data persistence choices and build the practical skills necessary for designing robust, data-driven applications.

### What You Will Achieve in These Labs:

Through the hands-on labs in this section, you will gain practical experience in:

1.  **Azure SQL Database Deployment & Configuration:**
    * Creating and configuring an Azure SQL Database server and a single database.
    * Understanding and applying **firewall rules** to control access to the SQL server.
    * Connecting to Azure SQL Database using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or Azure Data Studio.
    * (Optional) Exploring basic **performance tiers (DTU/vCore)** and scaling options.
    * Implementing basic **Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)**.
2.  **Azure Cosmos DB - Global Scale NoSQL:**
    * Creating an Azure Cosmos DB account with the **NoSQL API (Core SQL API)**.
    * Creating a new database and a container (collection) with a specified **partition key**.
    * Understanding the concept of **Request Units (RUs)** and provisioned throughput.
    * Adding and querying documents (items) within the Cosmos DB container using Data Explorer in the Azure Portal.
    * (Optional) Briefly exploring multi-region writes for Cosmos DB (conceptual setup).
3.  **Managed Open-Source Databases (e.g., Azure Database for MySQL/PostgreSQL Flexible Server):**
    * Deploying an Azure Database for MySQL or PostgreSQL **Flexible Server** instance.
    * Configuring **networking options** (e.g., Private Access with VNet integration) to ensure secure connectivity.
    * Connecting to the database using a common client tool (e.g., MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin).
    * (Optional) Exploring basic server parameters and their impact.
4.  **Azure Cache for Redis:**
    * Creating and configuring an Azure Cache for Redis instance.
    * Understanding different **pricing tiers** (Basic, Standard, Premium) and their features.
    * Retrieving **access keys and connection strings** for your cache.
    * (Optional) Integrating a simple application (e.g., a small web app or console app) to store and retrieve data from the cache.
5.  **Basic Database Migration Concepts (Demonstrative):**
    * (Optional/Conceptual) Brief demonstration or walkthrough of using **Azure Database Migration Service (DMS)** to simulate a simple schema migration to Azure SQL Database. This may involve using a pre-configured scenario or reviewing a simulated migration process to understand the steps involved.

### How These Labs Build Your Expertise:

These hands-on database labs are critical for your development as an Azure Solutions Architect. They will enable you to:

* **Select Optimal Data Stores:** Gain practical experience in deploying and interacting with different database services, helping you make informed decisions for diverse application requirements.
* **Design for Scalability & Performance:** Understand how to configure and scale databases for various workloads, including throughput and global distribution.
* **Implement Database Security:** Apply practical security measures like network isolation and encryption for your data at rest and in transit.
* **Optimize Data Access:** Learn how caching can significantly improve application responsiveness and reduce database load.
* **Prepare for Data Migrations:** Gain initial exposure to the process and tools involved in migrating existing databases to Azure.

Engage deeply with these labs. The more you configure, connect to, and interact with these database services, the stronger your practical understanding will become, which is indispensable for designing performant and robust data-driven solutions in Azure.
