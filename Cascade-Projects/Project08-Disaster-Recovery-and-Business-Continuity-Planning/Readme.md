# ðŸš€ Project 08: Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Planning

## Scenario: Global Manufacturing Co.'s Critical ERP System

Global Manufacturing Co. operates a custom-built Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system that is critical to their daily operations, including production scheduling, supply chain management, and financial reporting. The system currently runs on Azure VMs with an Azure SQL Database backend, all deployed in a single Azure region (East US).

They have recently experienced minor outages which highlighted the lack of a robust disaster recovery plan. The business leadership has mandated a comprehensive DR strategy to ensure minimal disruption in the event of a regional Azure outage.

### Key Requirements:

**Functional Requirements:**
* The ERP application must be accessible to users in case the primary Azure region becomes unavailable.
* All critical data (application data, database) must be replicated to a secondary region.

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
* **Recovery Time Objective (RTO):** The ERP system must be fully operational in the secondary region within **4 hours** of a disaster declaration.
* **Recovery Point Objective (RPO):** Maximum allowable data loss for the ERP system is **1 hour**.
* **High Availability (HA):** While the primary focus is cross-region DR, the solution should also incorporate intra-region HA where feasible.
* **Security:** Data in replication and at rest in the DR region must be secure. Access to DR resources must be tightly controlled.
* **Cost-Effectiveness:** The DR solution should be designed to optimize costs without compromising the RTO/RPO objectives. Avoid "active-active" unless strictly necessary for the RTO/RPO.
* **Testing:** The DR plan must be regularly testable without impacting the production environment.
* **Failback:** A clear strategy for failing back to the primary region once it's restored.

### Learning Objectives:

Upon completing this project, you should be able to:

* Distinguish between RTO and RPO and select appropriate Azure services to meet specific objectives.
* Design and implement a cross-region disaster recovery strategy for multi-tier applications (VMs, databases).
* Utilize Azure services like Azure Site Recovery, Azure SQL Database failover groups, and global traffic routing for DR.
* Incorporate high availability features within a region.
* Plan for network connectivity, identity, and application configuration in a DR scenario.
* Design a testable DR solution with consideration for cost optimization.
* Apply the Reliability pillar of the Azure Well-Architected Framework.

### Guidance/Hints:

* **RTO & RPO:** These are the most critical metrics. An RPO of 1 hour implies continuous or near-continuous data replication. An RTO of 4 hours means you need automated or highly scripted recovery processes.
* **Application Tier (VMs):** How will you replicate your ERP application VMs to a secondary region? Which Azure service is specifically designed for VM replication and orchestration of failovers?
* **Database Tier (Azure SQL Database):** Azure SQL Database has native capabilities for cross-region disaster recovery. Which feature allows you to set up automatic asynchronous replication and a failover mechanism with minimal data loss and quick recovery? (Hint: Failover Groups or Geo-replication). Consider if you need a specific service tier for your RPO/RTO.
* **Traffic Management:** Once the application is up in the secondary region, how will users be redirected to it automatically? (Hint: A global DNS-based load balancer).
* **Networking in DR Region:** Will the DR region have an identical VNet setup? How will IP addresses be handled during failover? Consider if you need to pre-provision network components in the secondary region.
* **Identity & Access:** How will users authenticate to the application in the DR region? If your identity solution is also in the primary region, how will it be available during a disaster? (Refer to Project 06 concepts).
* **Cost Optimization for DR:** An "active-passive" or "warm standby" approach is generally more cost-effective for DR than "active-active." How can you achieve the RTO/RPO without having all resources running at full capacity in the secondary region all the time?
* **Testing:** How can you perform a "test failover" without disrupting your production environment?

### Deliverables:

1.  **High-Level Architecture Diagram:** A visual representation of your proposed DR solution, showing the primary and secondary Azure regions, the key Azure services deployed in each, data replication paths, and user traffic flow during normal operations and during a disaster.
2.  **DR Strategy Document (Detailed):** A comprehensive write-up (e.g., 2-3 pages) detailing:
    * Your chosen DR strategy (e.g., warm standby, pilot light) and why it meets the RTO/RPO.
    * Specific Azure services used for each tier (Application, Database, Network, Traffic Management) and their configuration for DR.
    * How the solution addresses the RTO (<4 hours) and RPO (<1 hour) objectives.
    * Your plan for ensuring secure access to the DR environment.
    * A high-level cost optimization strategy for the DR infrastructure.
    * How you would conduct regular DR drills without impacting production.
    * A brief outline of your failback strategy.
3.  **(Optional) Recovery Playbook Outline:** A bulleted list of the key automated and manual steps that would be executed during a failover to the secondary region.

### Evaluation Criteria:

Your solution will be evaluated based on:

* **RTO/RPO Attainment:** Does the proposed solution realistically meet the specified RTO and RPO? Is the justification sound?
* **Comprehensive DR:** Does the plan cover all critical components of the ERP system (compute, data, network, identity)?
* **Service Selection:** Are the chosen Azure services appropriate and optimally configured for DR?
* **Cost vs. Resilience Trade-off:** Does the design demonstrate an understanding of cost implications for different DR strategies?
* **Testability & Recoverability:** Is the solution designed for easy testing and clear failback?
* **Clarity & Detail:** Is the architecture diagram clear, and is the explanation detailed and well-reasoned?

### Advanced Challenges/Extensions (Optional):

For those who want to push further:

* Integrate **Azure DevOps pipelines** to automate the DR failover and failback processes.
* Design for **application-consistent snapshots** during VM replication for transactional workloads.
* Consider using **Availability Zones** within each region to enhance intra-region HA *before* cross-region DR.
* Develop a **monitoring and alerting strategy** specifically for DR health (e.g., replication status, failover readiness).
* Explore using **Azure Chaos Studio** to test the resilience of your DR solution.
