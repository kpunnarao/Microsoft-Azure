# ðŸš€ Project 03: Hybrid Cloud File Sharing Solution

## Scenario: Fabrikam Inc.'s Distributed Design Team

Fabrikam Inc. is a design and engineering firm with offices in multiple cities and a significant amount of design files stored on on-premises file servers. Their design teams collaborate extensively on large CAD and design files, leading to challenges with version control, remote access for field engineers, and disaster recovery. They want to leverage Azure to address these issues, aiming for a hybrid file sharing solution that provides:
* Centralized, highly available storage in the cloud.
* Fast local access for on-premises users, minimizing latency.
* Secure access for remote users and field engineers over the internet.
* Improved disaster recovery capabilities for their file data.
* Seamless integration with existing Active Directory for permissions.

### Key Requirements:

**Functional Requirements:**
* Users in local offices must access files as if they were on a local file share.
* Remote and field engineers must be able to securely access files over the internet.
* File data must be centrally stored in Azure.
* Existing NTFS permissions from on-premises Active Directory must be preserved and enforced.
* Version control for files should be maintained.

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
* **Performance:** Local office users should experience near on-premises performance when accessing files.
* **High Availability (HA):** The cloud file share must be highly available and resilient to regional failures.
* **Security:**
    * File data must be encrypted at rest and in transit.
    * Access to files must be authenticated and authorized based on existing AD groups.
    * Remote access must be secured.
* **Manageability:** Minimize the administrative overhead of managing file shares across distributed offices.
* **Cost-Effectiveness:** Optimize storage costs, especially for cold or infrequently accessed data.
* **Disaster Recovery:** The solution should provide robust data recovery capabilities in case of local file server failure or disaster.

### Learning Objectives:

Upon completing this project, you should be able to:

* Design and implement a hybrid file sharing solution using Azure Files and Azure File Sync.
* Understand and configure secure connectivity options between on-premises and Azure.
* Integrate Azure Files with Active Directory for seamless permission management.
* Apply advanced storage features like access tiers and snapshots for cost optimization and data protection.
* Address performance, security, and availability concerns in a hybrid cloud context.
* Articulate the benefits and trade-offs of using Azure for hybrid file services.

### Guidance/Hints:

* **Core Services:** Azure Files will be your centralized cloud storage. How will you make it appear local and synchronize with on-premises servers? Consider **Azure File Sync**.
* **Connectivity:** How will your on-premises network connect to Azure to enable domain-joined file servers to access Azure File Shares? Think about network connectivity options you learned in Section 2 (e.g., VPN Gateway).
* **Identity:** How will existing on-premises Active Directory permissions be enforced on the Azure File Share? Look into **Azure AD DS** or **on-premises AD DS authentication for Azure Files**.
* **Performance Optimization:** Azure File Sync offers a **cloud tiering** feature. How can this help with local performance and cost optimization?
* **Security:** Ensure data is encrypted. How will remote users access files securely? Consider a secure gateway or VPN for remote access.
* **Data Protection:** How will you ensure data resilience within Azure and provide point-in-time recovery for accidental deletions or corruption? Think about snapshots.

### Deliverables:

1.  **High-Level Architecture Diagram:** A visual representation showing the on-premises network, connectivity to Azure, Azure services involved (Storage Account, File Share, File Sync components), and user access paths.
2.  **Service Justification Document (Brief):** A short write-up (e.g., 1-2 pages) explaining:
    * Your choice of Azure services (Azure Files, Azure File Sync, and connectivity method) and their configurations.
    * How your design addresses each of the key requirements (Performance, HA, Security, Manageability, Cost-Effectiveness, DR).
    * How you plan to integrate with existing Active Directory.
    * Any significant trade-offs you considered (e.g., different storage tiers, connectivity options).
3.  **(Optional) Basic Implementation Plan Outline:** Detail the key steps for setting up Azure Files, Azure File Sync, and configuring connectivity/AD integration.

### Evaluation Criteria:

Your solution will be evaluated based on:

* **Hybrid Integration:** Does the design seamlessly integrate on-premises and cloud components?
* **Performance & HA:** Does it address the local access performance requirement and ensure cloud storage HA?
* **Security:** Are appropriate security measures in place for data at rest, in transit, and access control?
* **Identity Management:** Is the AD integration sound and secure?
* **Cost-Effectiveness:** Does it consider storage tiering and other cost optimization strategies?
* **Clarity of Diagram & Explanation:** Is your architecture easy to understand and well-documented?

### Advanced Challenges/Extensions (Optional):

For those who want to push further:

* Integrate **Azure Backup** for Azure File Shares for long-term retention and additional DR capabilities.
* Consider using **private endpoints** for the Storage Account to ensure all communication within Azure and from on-premises (via VPN/ExpressRoute) remains within the private network.
* Design a solution for **large file transfers** for initial seeding or bulk data movement into Azure Files.
* Explore how to monitor the health and synchronization status of Azure File Sync agents using Azure Monitor.
