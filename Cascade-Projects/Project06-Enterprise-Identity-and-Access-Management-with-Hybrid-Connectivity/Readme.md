# ðŸš€ Project 06: Enterprise Identity and Access Management with Hybrid Connectivity

## Scenario: Contoso Retail's Unified Identity System

Contoso Retail, a large enterprise with thousands of employees and an existing on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), is aggressively adopting Azure for new applications and migrating some legacy systems. They face challenges with:
* Managing user identities across both on-premises and cloud environments.
* Ensuring secure access to cloud resources for employees, even when working remotely.
* Providing secure access for external partners to specific B2B applications.
* Maintaining a consistent identity experience for employees accessing both legacy on-premises apps and new Azure cloud apps.
* Implementing strong authentication and granular access control.

### Key Requirements:

**Functional Requirements:**
* Centralized management of employee identities, synchronized between on-premises AD DS and Azure.
* Single Sign-On (SSO) for employees accessing both on-premises applications (where possible) and Azure-hosted applications.
* Secure access for external partners (suppliers, contractors) to specific Azure applications.
* Ability to enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for high-privilege users and for access to sensitive applications.
* Group-based access control for Azure resources.

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
* **Security:**
    * Strong authentication for all users.
    * Least privilege access model for Azure resources.
    * Protection against common identity-related threats (e.g., brute force, credential theft).
    * Data in transit for synchronization must be secure.
* **Manageability:** Minimize the administrative overhead for identity management.
* **Scalability:** The identity solution must scale to thousands of users.
* **Reliability:** High availability for identity services to ensure continuous access to applications.
* **Compliance:** Ability to implement policies that enforce security standards (e.g., requiring compliant devices, specific locations for access).
* **User Experience:** Seamless and intuitive authentication experience for users.

### Learning Objectives:

Upon completing this project, you should be able to:

* Design a hybrid identity solution leveraging Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) and on-premises AD DS.
* Implement synchronization between on-premises and cloud directories.
* Configure advanced security features like Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and Conditional Access policies.
* Differentiate between and implement solutions for internal employees, external partners (B2B), and consumer identities (B2C - conceptual if not directly in scope).
* Design granular access control for Azure resources using Azure RBAC.
* Understand the role of Managed Identities and Service Principals for application authentication.
* Apply principles of the Azure Well-Architected Framework (Security, Operational Excellence) to identity architecture.

### Guidance/Hints:

* **Hybrid Identity:** What tool is specifically designed to synchronize users, groups, and passwords/password hashes from on-premises AD DS to Microsoft Entra ID? (Hint: Azure AD Connect). Consider the different authentication methods (password hash sync, pass-through authentication, federation).
* **Access Control:** How will you manage permissions to Azure resources? Think about **Azure RBAC** and its scopes. How can you simplify RBAC assignment for groups of users?
* **Strong Authentication:** How will you enforce MFA for specific users or applications? Look at **Conditional Access policies**. What conditions and grants can you configure?
* **External Access:** For partners, which Microsoft Entra ID feature allows collaboration with external users using their existing identities? (Hint: Azure AD B2B).
* **Application Authentication:** For Azure-hosted applications, how can they securely access other Azure resources without hardcoding credentials? (Hint: Managed Identities). When would you use a Service Principal instead?
* **Privileged Access:** How would you protect highly privileged administrative accounts? (Hint: PIM).
* **Connectivity for Authentication:** If you choose a federated or pass-through authentication model, how will on-premises AD infrastructure communicate securely with Azure? (Network connectivity, e.g., VPN).

### Deliverables:

1.  **High-Level Architecture Diagram:** A visual representation of your proposed hybrid identity solution, showing the flow of identity synchronization, user authentication paths for both on-premises and Azure apps, and access to Azure resources.
2.  **Service Justification Document (Brief):** A short write-up (e.g., 1-2 pages) explaining:
    * Your choice of Microsoft Entra ID synchronization method and why.
    * Your strategy for MFA and Conditional Access policies, providing specific examples.
    * How you would manage access for employees and external partners.
    * Your approach to implementing Azure RBAC for resource access.
    * Any significant security or operational trade-offs considered (e.g., complexity vs. security).
3.  **(Optional) Role/Policy Sketch:** Outline a few key RBAC roles or Conditional Access policies you would implement.

### Evaluation Criteria:

Your solution will be evaluated based on:

* **Completeness:** Does it address all identity requirements for internal and external users?
* **Security:** Is the identity solution robust, secure, and aligned with least privilege principles? Are MFA and Conditional Access appropriately applied?
* **Hybrid Integration:** Is the synchronization and authentication flow between on-premises and Azure clearly defined and sound?
* **Manageability:** Does the design minimize administrative overhead for identity management?
* **Clarity of Diagram & Explanation:** Is your architecture easy to understand and well-documented?

### Advanced Challenges/Extensions (Optional):

For those who want to push further:

* Design a solution for **Just-In-Time (JIT) access** for privileged roles using Privileged Identity Management (PIM).
* Explore integrating **Microsoft Entra ID Protection** for risk-based conditional access.
* Detail how you would implement **device compliance** as a condition for accessing sensitive applications.
* Consider a scenario where the company acquires another entity with its own AD, and how you would integrate it (Multi-forest sync).
* Propose how **Azure AD B2C** would fit into a scenario for public-facing consumer applications.
