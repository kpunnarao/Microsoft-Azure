# ðŸš€ Project 07: Secure Microservices Platform on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

## Scenario: Northwind Traders' New Order Processing Microservices

Northwind Traders is modernizing its legacy monolithic order processing system into a set of independent microservices. They have chosen containerization and Kubernetes as their platform of choice for scalability, agility, and resilience. They need an Azure-based solution that can:
* Host multiple microservices securely.
* Handle fluctuating loads, scaling services independently.
* Provide robust networking and traffic management for internal and external communication.
* Integrate with their existing Azure identity for access control to Kubernetes resources.
* Securely manage application secrets.
* Provide comprehensive monitoring and logging for all microservices.

### Key Requirements:

**Functional Requirements:**
* Deploy multiple containerized microservices (e.g., Order Service, Inventory Service, Payment Service).
* Expose a public API gateway for external clients to interact with the microservices.
* Allow internal microservices to communicate securely with each other and with backend databases.
* Provide persistent storage for services that require it (e.g., a database service if deployed within AKS, or integration with external Azure DBs).

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
* **Scalability:** Individual microservices should be able to scale horizontally based on demand. The underlying cluster should also scale efficiently.
* **Security:**
    * Network isolation between microservices where appropriate.
    * Secure access to secrets (e.g., database connection strings).
    * Secure access for developers/administrators to the Kubernetes cluster.
    * Container image scanning for vulnerabilities.
    * Public API gateway must have WAF capabilities.
* **High Availability (HA):** The Kubernetes cluster and deployed microservices should be highly available.
* **Observability:** Comprehensive logging, monitoring, and alerting for container health, performance, and application errors.
* **Manageability:** Automate deployments of microservices (CI/CD integration is a plus, but core platform setup is primary).
* **Cost-Effectiveness:** Optimize AKS cluster size and node types.

### Learning Objectives:

Upon completing this project, you should be able to:

* Design a secure and scalable Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster architecture.
* Implement robust networking for containerized applications, including ingress and internal communication.
* Integrate AKS with Azure's identity and access management solutions (Microsoft Entra ID, RBAC).
* Choose and configure appropriate storage solutions for containerized workloads.
* Design for secret management and application security within a Kubernetes environment.
* Implement comprehensive monitoring for AKS and its deployed microservices.
* Apply principles of the Azure Well-Architected Framework (Security, Performance Efficiency, Operational Excellence) to a containerized platform.

### Guidance/Hints:

* **AKS Configuration:** Consider choosing the appropriate AKS SKU and node pool configurations. How will you ensure HA for the control plane and nodes? (Hint: Availability Zones).
* **Networking:**
    * How will external traffic reach your public API gateway? (Hint: Application Gateway as Ingress Controller or Azure Front Door).
    * How will pods get IP addresses? (Azure CNI vs. Kubenet). When would you choose one over the other?
    * How will microservices communicate securely with each other within the cluster? (Network Policies, Service Mesh - if you want an advanced topic).
    * How will AKS communicate securely with Azure services (e.g., Azure Container Registry, Azure Key Vault)? (Private Link, Service Endpoints).
* **Container Registry:** Where will your container images be stored and managed? (Hint: Azure Container Registry). How do you ensure secure access from AKS?
* **Secret Management:** How will your microservices securely retrieve database connection strings or other sensitive data? (Hint: Azure Key Vault, integration with AKS via CSI Driver).
* **Monitoring:** What Azure service provides deep insights into AKS cluster health, node performance, and container logs/metrics? (Hint: Azure Monitor for Containers / Container Insights). How would you collect application logs?
* **Identity for AKS:** How will developers/administrators authenticate to the AKS cluster using their corporate identities? How will AKS itself authenticate to Azure resources like ACR or Key Vault? (Hint: Microsoft Entra ID integration for AKS, Managed Identities for pods/cluster).
* **Persistent Storage:** For stateful microservices (e.g., a database running *inside* AKS, though generally not recommended for production), how would you provide persistent storage? (Azure Disk, Azure Files CSI drivers).

### Deliverables:

1.  **High-Level Architecture Diagram:** A visual representation of your proposed AKS platform, showing the AKS cluster, networking components, ingress, Azure Container Registry, Key Vault, and monitoring services. Clearly indicate public/private access paths.
2.  **Service Justification Document (Brief):** A short write-up (e.g., 2-3 pages) explaining:
    * Your AKS deployment choices (SKU, networking model, HA setup).
    * How you will handle ingress and internal service communication.
    * Your strategy for secret management and container image security.
    * How you will monitor the platform and application performance.
    * Your plan for integrating with Microsoft Entra ID for cluster access and application identity.
    * Any significant trade-offs considered (e.g., AKS networking options, secret management approaches).
3.  **(Optional) Kubernetes Resource Sketch:** A simple sketch of key Kubernetes resources (e.g., Deployment, Service, Ingress) for a sample microservice.

### Evaluation Criteria:

Your solution will be evaluated based on:

* **AKS Design:** Is the AKS cluster configuration sound for a production microservices environment, considering HA and scalability?
* **Networking:** Are the ingress and internal communication patterns well-defined and secure?
* **Security:** Are secret management, identity integration, and network isolation robust?
* **Observability:** Is there a clear plan for monitoring the health and performance of the platform and applications?
* **Adherence to Best Practices:** Does the design align with typical microservices and AKS best practices?
* **Clarity of Diagram & Explanation:** Is your architecture easy to understand and well-documented?

### Advanced Challenges/Extensions (Optional):

For those who want to push further:

* Integrate **Azure Policy for AKS** to enforce security best practices at the cluster level.
* Explore implementing a **service mesh** (e.g., Linkerd, Istio) for advanced traffic management, security, and observability between microservices.
* Design for **multi-cluster deployment** for disaster recovery or global presence.
* Detail a **CI/CD pipeline** for deploying microservices to AKS, including automated image builds and deployments.
* Consider **cost optimization strategies** for AKS (e.g., Spot Node Pools, Horizontal Pod Autoscaler, Cluster Autoscaler).
