# Availability Sets vs. Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS) üöÄüõ°Ô∏è

It's common for newcomers to Azure to get these two concepts mixed up, as both contribute to high availability. 

Let's break down the key differences between Azure **Availability Sets** and **Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS)**.


While both Availability Sets and Virtual Machine Scale Sets aim to provide high availability for your applications in Azure, they serve different primary purposes and offer different capabilities.

Think of them as complementary, rather than mutually exclusive, tools.

| Feature             | Availability Set (AS)                                     | Virtual Machine Scale Set (VMSS)                               |
| :------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary Purpose** | **High Availability for a FIXED number of VMs.** Ensures VMs are protected from single points of failure within a datacenter (rack, power, network). | **Scalability, High Availability, and Simplified Management** of a group of identical, auto-scaling VMs. |
| **VM Count** | Designed for a **fixed, relatively small number** of VMs (e.g., 2-5). You manually manage each VM's lifecycle. | Designed for a **variable and potentially large number** of VMs (from 0 to 1000+). Automatically scales instances up or down. |
| **VM Identity** | VMs are **discrete entities**. They can be configured individually (though for HA, you'd typically keep them similar). | VMs are generally **identical** (especially in Uniform orchestration). They are part of a larger managed group. |
| **Scaling** | **Manual scaling only**. You add or remove VMs one by one. | **Automatic scaling** based on metrics, schedules, or manual input. |
| **Load Balancing** | Not built-in. Requires a separate **Azure Load Balancer** to distribute traffic across VMs in the AS. | **Built-in integration with Azure Load Balancer** (Standard or Application Gateway) which is automatically configured. |
| **Management** | Manage VMs individually. Patching, updates, and configuration are done per VM. | Manage the entire **scale set** as a single resource. Simplifies patching, updates, and consistent configuration across all instances. |
| **SLA** | **99.95%** uptime for 2+ VMs in an AS within a single region (datacenter). | **99.99%** uptime when deployed across 2+ Availability Zones (Flexible orchestration). Also provides high availability within a region via Fault Domains. |
| **Fault/Update Domain Awareness** | Explicitly places VMs across **Fault Domains** and **Update Domains** within a single datacenter. | Automatically distributes VMs across **Fault Domains** (and optionally **Availability Zones** in Flexible orchestration) for resiliency. |
| **Orchestration** | N/A (manually managed VMs)                                | **Uniform** (all identical VMs) or **Flexible** (more control over individual VMs, can mix and match, recommended for new deployments). |
| **Cost** | No direct cost for the Availability Set itself; you pay for the individual VMs. | No direct cost for the Scale Set itself; you pay for the underlying VM instances, load balancer, and other consumed resources. Helps optimize costs via auto-scaling. |
| **Typical Use Cases** | - **Domain Controllers**: Fixed number of critical servers that need high availability but not dynamic scaling. \<br\> - **Active-passive clusters**: Where one VM is active and another is standby. \<br\> - **Applications with unique configurations**: When each VM in the set might have slightly different software or roles. | - **Web Front-ends**: Websites, APIs, or any application with fluctuating user traffic. \<br\> - **Container Orchestration**: Underlying compute for AKS, Service Fabric, etc. \<br\> - **Batch Processing**: Running large, parallelizable compute jobs. \<br\> - **Microservices**: Scaling individual services independently. |
| **Creation Flow** | You first create the Availability Set, then add VMs to it during VM creation. Cannot add existing VMs. | You create the Scale Set, and it provisions the VMs as part of its definition. |

### When to Choose Which?

  * **Choose an Availability Set when:**

      * You have a **fixed number of VMs** that run a critical application.
      * Your VMs have **unique configurations** or roles (e.g., a primary database server and a secondary replica, or different tiers of an application that don't need to scale independently).
      * You need high availability *within a single Azure datacenter* and don't require automatic scaling.
      * You need to maintain more granular control over individual VM lifecycles.

  * **Choose a Virtual Machine Scale Set (VMSS) when:**

      * Your application can benefit from **automatic scaling** based on demand.
      * Your application is **stateless or can easily handle state externally** (e.g., in a database or shared storage), allowing identical instances to be added or removed.
      * You need to deploy and manage a **large number of identical VMs** efficiently.
      * You want the highest possible SLA for VMs (99.99% with Availability Zones).
      * You want simplified management of updates and consistent configurations across many instances.
      * You are building modern, cloud-native applications or containerized workloads (like Kubernetes).

### Can they be used together?

While you generally don't put a VMSS *inside* an Availability Set (because VMSS inherently provides similar and often superior fault/update domain distribution), you can deploy a VMSS across **Availability Zones**.

In fact, with VMSS's **Flexible orchestration mode**, you can even gain more fine-grained control, where individual VMs within the scale set are managed, yet still benefit from the scale set's auto-scaling and simplified image management capabilities, while being distributed across fault domains or Availability Zones.

This makes Flexible orchestration VMSS often the preferred choice for new deployments aiming for both high availability and scalability.

In essence: **Availability Sets** are about **resiliency for a few, potentially unique VMs**. **Virtual Machine Scale Sets** are about **elasticity and simplified management for many, typically identical VMs**.
