# Key Differences and Use Cases for each

Azure Front Door and Azure Application Gateway are both Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS) load balancers, but they serve different scopes and have distinct feature sets.

The primary difference lies in their **scope of operation**: Front Door is a **global** service, while Application Gateway is a **regional** service.

## Key Differences üìä

| Feature             | Azure Front Door                                  | Azure Application Gateway                         |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------ |
| **Scope** | **Global**. Operates at Microsoft's edge PoPs worldwide. | **Regional**. Deployed within a single Azure region (can span Availability Zones). |
| **Traffic Routing** | Routes traffic to the **closest healthy backend** globally (based on latency, priority, weighted, geographic). | Routes traffic **within a region** to backend servers/VMs. |
| **Network** | Leverages **Microsoft's private global network** for optimized routing from the edge to the origin. | Routes traffic within your **Virtual Network**. |
| **Primary Use** | **Global application delivery**, performance acceleration, high availability across regions. | **Regional application delivery**, advanced traffic management within a VNet. |
| **CDN Capabilities**| **Built-in CDN capabilities** (caching, dynamic site acceleration). | No built-in CDN capabilities.                     |
| **WAF Location** | WAF protection applied at the **edge PoP** (closer to the user). | WAF protection applied at the **VNet perimeter** (within your region). |
| **Backend Types** | Can route to **publicly accessible** endpoints (public IPs, DNS names) anywhere. | Typically routes to **private IPs** within an Azure VNet. |
| **SSL Offload** | Performs SSL offload at the **edge PoP**.        | Performs SSL offload at the **gateway within the region**. |
| **Static IP** | Does **not** provide a static public IP (uses Anycast). | Provides a **static public IP** (or private IP for internal). |
| **Connection Draining** | **No** native support for connection draining.   | **Supports** connection draining.                 |
| **mTLS** | **No** native support for mutual TLS authentication. | **Supports** mutual TLS authentication.           |
| **Cost** | Generally **more cost-effective for global** deployments (can replace multiple regional components). | Costs tied to instances, data processed; can be more economical for **regional-only** needs. |

## Use Cases for Each üéØ

### Azure Front Door Use Cases

Choose **Azure Front Door** when your application has a **global reach** or requires **enhanced performance and security at the edge**.

* **Global Applications**: Deploying web applications or APIs that serve users worldwide, where low latency and high availability across different continents are critical.
* **Dynamic Site Acceleration (DSA)**: Applications with dynamic content that needs to be delivered quickly to users regardless of their location (e.g., e-commerce sites, interactive web apps).
* **Seamless Global Failover**: Mission-critical applications requiring automatic, near-instantaneous failover across multiple Azure regions in case of a regional outage.
* **Centralized WAF for Global Traffic**: Protecting web applications from common web attacks with a WAF that operates at the network edge, blocking threats before they reach your Azure regions.
* **API Acceleration**: Accelerating and securing API endpoints for distributed client applications.
* **Managed SSL/TLS**: When you want Azure to fully manage SSL certificate lifecycle (provisioning, renewal) for your custom domains.
* **A/B Testing or Blue/Green Deployments Globally**: Gradually rolling out new features or application versions to a subset of global users.

### Azure Application Gateway Use Cases

Choose **Azure Application Gateway** when your application is primarily **regional** or requires **deep integration within your Azure Virtual Network** and specific Layer 7 features.

* **Regional Web Applications**: Load balancing HTTP/HTTPS traffic among web servers or microservices within a single Azure region.
* **Private Backends**: When your backend web servers or services need to be **private** (not publicly accessible via public IPs) within an Azure Virtual Network.
* **Advanced URL-based Routing**: Implementing complex routing rules based on URL paths, host headers, or other HTTP attributes to direct traffic to different backend pools within a VNet.
* **Session Persistence**: Applications that require requests from a specific user to consistently return to the same backend server (cookie-based session affinity).
* **WAF for Regional Applications**: Providing WAF protection for web applications that are accessed predominantly from a specific region or need granular WAF controls directly at the VNet boundary.
* **Connection Draining**: Gracefully removing backend servers from rotation during maintenance or scaling operations, allowing active connections to complete before termination.
* **Mutual TLS Authentication**: If your application requires both client and server authentication via TLS certificates.
* **Internal Load Balancing**: When you need an internal-facing load balancer for web applications that are only accessible from within your private network.

### Using Them Together ü§ù

It's also a common and often recommended architecture to use **Azure Front Door in front of Azure Application Gateway**.

* **Front Door** provides global load balancing, WAF at the edge, CDN capabilities, and optimized routing over Microsoft's backbone network.
* **Application Gateway** then provides regional Layer 7 load balancing, a second layer of WAF (if needed, or for more granular control), URL-based routing, and SSL termination for traffic *within* that specific Azure region, directing traffic to your private backend services.

This combined approach offers the best of both worlds: global performance and security from Front Door, coupled with regional traffic management and deeper VNet integration from Application Gateway.
