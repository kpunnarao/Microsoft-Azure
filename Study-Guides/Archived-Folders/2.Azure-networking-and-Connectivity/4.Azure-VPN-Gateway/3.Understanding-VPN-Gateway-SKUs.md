# Understanding VPN Gateway SKUs:

## Understanding Azure VPN Gateway SKUs üè∑Ô∏è

When you deploy an Azure VPN Gateway, you need to choose a **SKU (Stock Keeping Unit)**. The SKU determines the gateway's **capabilities, performance (throughput), features, and ultimately, its cost**. Choosing the right SKU is crucial for balancing performance requirements with budget constraints.

Azure VPN Gateway SKUs are categorized into **Generations** (Generation1 and Generation2) and offer various performance tiers. There are also **Zone-Redundant SKUs** for enhanced availability.

### Key Characteristics Determined by SKU:

1.  **Aggregate Throughput Benchmark**: This is the maximum combined bandwidth (ingress + egress) that the VPN Gateway can handle across all its connections. It's an aggregate benchmark, not a guaranteed per-tunnel throughput.
2.  **Number of Site-to-Site/VNet-to-VNet Tunnels**: The maximum number of concurrent IPsec S2S or VNet-to-VNet connections the gateway can support.
3.  **Number of Point-to-Site Connections**: The maximum number of concurrent P2S VPN clients the gateway can support (further broken down by IKEv2/OpenVPN and SSTP).
4.  **BGP Support**: Whether the SKU supports Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) for dynamic routing. BGP allows your on-premises routers to automatically exchange routes with your Azure VNet, simplifying network management.
5.  **Zone-Redundancy (AZ SKUs)**: Whether the gateway instances are deployed across Azure Availability Zones for higher resilience against zone-level failures. This offers improved SLA.
6.  **Cost**: Higher performance and redundancy naturally come with a higher hourly compute cost. Data transfer costs are typically separate and based on egress traffic from Azure.

### Azure VPN Gateway SKU Generations üìä

Azure VPN Gateway SKUs are grouped into generations: **Generation1** and **Generation2**. Generation2 SKUs generally offer better performance and more advanced features for the equivalent tier compared to Generation1.

As of recent updates (with further changes planned through 2026), Microsoft is consolidating and transitioning non-Availability Zone (AZ) supported SKUs to AZ-supported SKUs. This means that while some older SKUs are being retired or migrated, the focus is shifting towards Zone-Redundant options for better reliability.

*Note: If you need more than 100 S2S VPN tunnels, consider using **Azure Virtual WAN** instead of VPN Gateway, as it's designed for large-scale, global connectivity.*

### Choosing the Right SKU ü§î

When selecting a VPN Gateway SKU, consider the following:

* **Bandwidth Requirements**: What is the expected aggregate data transfer rate through the VPN tunnel(s)?
* **Number of Connections**: How many Site-to-Site VPNs do you need? How many remote users will connect via Point-to-Site?
* **Availability/Resilience**: Do you need zone-redundancy for higher uptime? For mission-critical workloads, AZ SKUs are highly recommended.
* **Routing Complexity**: Do you require BGP for dynamic routing with your on-premises network?
* **Cost**: Compare the hourly compute cost of different SKUs against your performance and feature needs. Remember to also account for **egress data transfer costs**, which are billed separately.
* **Future Growth**: Choose a SKU that can accommodate some future growth to avoid frequent upgrades, which can cause downtime.
* **Public IP SKU**: Be aware that higher-tier VPN Gateway SKUs often require a **Standard SKU Public IP address**, which has different features and potentially a different billing model than Basic Public IPs.
* **Legacy SKUs**: The `Basic` SKU is often used for dev/test. `Standard` and `High Performance` are legacy SKUs that are being deprecated/migrated to the newer VpnGw# and VpnGw#AZ SKUs. Avoid deploying these legacy SKUs for new production environments.

By carefully evaluating these factors, you can select the most appropriate Azure VPN Gateway SKU for your specific hybrid cloud connectivity needs.
