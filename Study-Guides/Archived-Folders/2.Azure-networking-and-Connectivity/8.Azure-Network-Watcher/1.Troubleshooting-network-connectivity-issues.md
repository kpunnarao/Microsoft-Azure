# Troubleshooting Network Connectivity Issues üõ†Ô∏è

Troubleshooting network connectivity in Azure involves systematically identifying and resolving problems that prevent resources from communicating with each other or with external networks. 

Given the distributed nature of cloud environments, traditional on-premises tools might not directly apply, making Azure-native tools like Network Watcher indispensable.

Network connectivity issues can manifest in various ways:

* **Virtual Machines (VMs) can't ping each other or external resources.**
* **Web applications are unreachable or show timeouts.**
* **VPN or ExpressRoute connections are down or unstable.**
* **Services fail to communicate with databases.**
* **Slow performance or high latency for network-dependent applications.**

The process generally involves these steps:

1.  **Identify the Scope**: Is the problem affecting a single VM, a specific subnet, an entire VNet, or communication to an external network (Internet, on-premises)?
2.  **Verify Basic Connectivity**: Confirm that the resources are running and have valid IP configurations.
3.  **Check Network Security Groups (NSGs)**: NSGs are often the culprit. They act as a firewall, controlling inbound and outbound traffic at the VM or subnet level. Misconfigured NSG rules can easily block legitimate traffic.
4.  **Examine Routing**: Ensure traffic is taking the expected path. Custom routes (User Defined Routes - UDRs) can override default Azure routing and lead to unexpected behavior.
5.  **Review DNS Resolution**: If resources can't resolve hostnames, they can't establish connections.
6.  **Analyze Firewall Policies**: Beyond NSGs, other firewalls (Azure Firewall, VM host-based firewalls, NVA firewalls) can block traffic.
7.  **Monitor Performance**: High latency or packet loss can indicate congestion or routing inefficiencies.

Azure Network Watcher provides a suite of tools specifically designed to help with these troubleshooting steps, offering insights that are difficult or impossible to gain otherwise in a software-defined network. It allows you to:

* **Verify IP Flow**: Determine if a packet is allowed or denied to/from a VM based on NSG rules.
* **Capture NSG Flow Logs**: See source/destination IPs, ports, and protocols for traffic allowed or denied by NSGs.
* **Monitor Connections**: Proactively monitor connectivity to endpoints and detect network performance issues.
* **Analyze Next Hop**: Identify the next hop for traffic, helping to diagnose routing problems.
* **View Network Topology**: Visualize the network configuration and identify potential bottlenecks or misconfigurations.

By systematically using these tools, you can pinpoint the exact cause of connectivity problems and implement effective solutions.
