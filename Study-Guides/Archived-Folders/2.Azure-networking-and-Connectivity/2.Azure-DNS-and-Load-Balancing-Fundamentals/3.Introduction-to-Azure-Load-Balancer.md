# Introduction to Azure Load Balancer (Basic vs Standard):

Azure Load Balancer is a **Layer 4 (Transport Layer)** load balancing service that distributes inbound flows that arrive at the load balancer's frontend to instances in the backend pool. 

It works with TCP and UDP protocols and is designed for high performance and low latency, handling millions of flows per second.

It serves as the **single point of contact** for clients, directing traffic to healthy backend virtual machines (VMs) or virtual machine scale sets (VMSS) based on configured load-balancing rules and health probes. 

This ensures **high availability** and **scalability** for your applications by preventing any single resource from becoming a bottleneck or a single point of failure.

Azure Load Balancer comes in two primary SKUs: **Basic** and **Standard**. These SKUs differ significantly in their capabilities, scale, features, and pricing, catering to different application needs.

## Basic vs. Standard Azure Load Balancer

Here's a comparison of the key differences between the Basic and Standard SKUs:

| Feature/Capability      | Basic Load Balancer                                   | Standard Load Balancer                                 |
| :---------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Retirement Status** | **Being retired on September 30, 2025**. Migrate to Standard. | **Generally Available (GA)** and recommended for most scenarios. |
| **Pricing** | Free (you pay for associated VMs/data transfer)      | Pay-as-you-go model (based on rules and data processed). |
| **SLA (Service Level Agreement)** | No SLA                                                | **99.99% SLA** |
| **Frontend IPs** | Public IP only (cannot use Private IPs for frontend)  | Supports both **Public and Private IP** frontends.      |
| **Backend Pool Size** | Limited to **300 instances**.                        | Supports up to **1000 instances**.                      |
| **Backend Pool Type** | NIC-based only. Limited to VMs in a single Availability Set or VMSS. | **IP-based and NIC-based**. Supports any VM or VMSS in a single VNet. |
| **Availability Zones** | **Not Zone-aware**. Cannot be zone-redundant.         | **Zone-redundant** and **Zonal** deployments supported for high availability. |
| **Outbound Connections**| **Open to the Internet by default**.                  | **Closed to outbound by default**. Requires explicit outbound rules or a NAT Gateway for outbound connectivity. |
| **Security Model** | Less secure by default (open to internet).           | **Secure by default** (Zero Trust model). Requires NSGs to explicitly allow inbound traffic. |
| **Health Probes** | Basic health probes (TCP, HTTP, HTTPS).               | Enhanced health probes, including custom paths and more granular settings. |
| **Diagnostics** | Limited diagnostics.                                  | **Azure Monitor multi-dimensional metrics**, diagnostic logs, Resource Health. |
| **Multiple Frontend IPs** | Inbound only.                                         | **Multiple Frontend IPs** for both inbound and outbound. |
| **HA Ports (High Availability Ports)** | Not supported.                                        | **Supported**. Enables load balancing on all ports simultaneously (e.g., for NVAs). |
| **Global VNet Peering** | Not supported for Internal Load Balancer.             | **Supported** for Standard Internal Load Balancer.      |
| **Private Link Support**| Not supported for Internal Load Balancer.             | **Supported** for Standard Internal Load Balancer.      |
| **TCP Reset on Idle** | Not available.                                        | Available on any rule, better connection management.    |
| **Recommended Use Case**| **Not recommended for new deployments** due to retirement. Legacy/Small dev/test workloads. | **Recommended for most production workloads** requiring high availability, scalability, and enhanced security. |

## Key Components of Azure Load Balancer

Regardless of the SKU, an Azure Load Balancer consists of several core components:

* **Frontend IP configuration**: The IP address(es) where the load balancer receives incoming traffic. This can be a public IP for internet-facing applications or a private IP for internal applications.
* **Backend Pools**: A group of virtual machines or virtual machine scale sets that will receive the load-balanced traffic. The load balancer distributes traffic among the healthy instances in this pool.
* **Health Probes**: Mechanisms used by the load balancer to monitor the health and availability of instances in the backend pool. If an instance fails a health probe, the load balancer stops sending new traffic to it until it becomes healthy again.
* **Load Balancing Rules**: Define how inbound traffic arriving at a frontend IP is distributed to the instances in the backend pool. These rules specify the protocol (TCP/UDP), port, and often enable features like session persistence.
* **Inbound NAT Rules**: Allows direct access to specific ports on individual backend instances (e.g., RDP/SSH to a specific VM behind the load balancer, not load balanced).
* **Outbound Rules (Standard LB only)**: Explicitly define how backend instances can initiate outbound connections to the internet.

## When to Choose Which?

Given the impending retirement of Basic Load Balancer, the answer is straightforward for new deployments:

* **For almost all new deployments and production workloads, use the Standard Load Balancer.** It offers superior features, higher scale, enhanced security (secure by default), zone redundancy for high availability, and an SLA.
* **If you have existing Basic Load Balancers, prioritize migrating them to Standard Load Balancer** before the retirement date to avoid service disruption and leverage the benefits of the Standard SKU. Azure provides guidance and scripts for this upgrade process.

Azure Load Balancer is a critical service for building resilient and scalable applications in the cloud, and the Standard SKU is the modern, feature-rich choice for robust solutions.
