# Introduction to ExpressRoute for Dedicated Private Connectivity üöÑ

Azure ExpressRoute is an Azure service that allows you to create **private, dedicated, high-bandwidth connections** between your on-premises infrastructure and Microsoft's global network, including Azure cloud services and Microsoft 365. 

Unlike VPN Gateway, which uses encrypted tunnels over the public internet, ExpressRoute establishes a direct physical or logical connection, offering superior reliability, speed, and lower latency.

Think of it as having a **private, high-speed rail line** directly connecting your corporate data center to Azure, bypassing all the public roads and potential traffic jams of the internet.

## How ExpressRoute Works ‚öôÔ∏è

ExpressRoute works by establishing connections through a **connectivity provider**. Here's a breakdown of the key concepts:

1.  **Private Connection**: ExpressRoute uses a private connection, not the public internet. This connection is established with an ExpressRoute partner (a network service provider).
2.  **Peering Locations**: ExpressRoute circuits connect your on-premises network to Microsoft's network at **ExpressRoute peering locations** (also known as "meet-me-locations" or "exchange provider locations"). These are physical facilities where network service providers and Microsoft's network meet.
3.  **Circuit**: An ExpressRoute circuit is a logical connection between your on-premises network and Microsoft cloud services through a connectivity provider. Circuits are configured for a specific bandwidth (e.g., 50 Mbps, 1 Gbps, 10 Gbps).
4.  **Redundancy**: ExpressRoute circuits are designed for high availability. Each circuit consists of two connections to two separate Microsoft Enterprise edge routers (MSEE) at an ExpressRoute peering location. This dual connection provides inherent redundancy, ensuring no single point of failure on the Microsoft side.
5.  **Traffic Path**: Your on-premises network sends traffic over your chosen connectivity provider's network to the ExpressRoute peering location. From there, it enters the Microsoft backbone network privately and securely, routing to your Azure VNets or Microsoft 365 services.
6.  **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)**: ExpressRoute uses BGP for dynamic routing between your on-premises network and Microsoft's network. This allows for automatic exchange of routes, simplifying network management and enabling robust, redundant routing paths.
7.  **Private IP Addressing**: All traffic over ExpressRoute uses private IP addresses. Your Azure VNets connect to the ExpressRoute circuit using private IP ranges, and your on-premises network communicates with Azure services over these private routes.

## ExpressRoute Peering Types üåê

ExpressRoute circuits support two types of peering, allowing access to different Microsoft services:

1.  **Azure Private Peering**:
    * This enables private, dedicated connectivity to your **Azure Virtual Networks (VNets)**.
    * Traffic here uses **private IP addresses** (RFC 1918 or public IPs you own and allocate to Azure).
    * It's the primary way to connect your on-premises data center to your Azure VMs, databases, and other IaaS/PaaS resources deployed within your VNets.

2.  **Microsoft Peering**:
    * This enables public IP addresses for connecting to **Microsoft's public cloud services** that are not part of your Azure VNet.
    * This includes services like **Microsoft 365 (formerly Office 365), Dynamics 365, Azure PaaS services** accessed via their public endpoints (e.g., Azure Storage Blob public endpoint, Azure SQL Database public endpoint).
    * Traffic here uses **public IP addresses** (you need to own and advertise these to Microsoft).
    * **Note**: While it uses public IP addresses, the traffic still traverses the private ExpressRoute circuit and Microsoft's backbone, bypassing the public internet. This is beneficial for performance and reliability for services like Microsoft 365, which traditionally rely on internet connectivity.

## Key Concepts and Components üåü

* **ExpressRoute Circuit**: The logical connection to Microsoft cloud services. It's provisioned by a connectivity provider and connects your on-premises network to Microsoft's network.
* **Circuit Bandwidth**: You choose a specific bandwidth for your circuit (e.g., 50 Mbps, 1 Gbps, 10 Gbps). This is the maximum capacity of your connection.
* **ExpressRoute Standard vs. Premium Add-on**:
    * **Standard**: Limits the number of VNets you can connect, and connectivity is only to the geopolitical region of the peering location.
    * **Premium Add-on**: Offers global connectivity to Azure regions (outside the geopolitical region of the peering), allows more VNets per circuit, and supports more routes.
* **ExpressRoute Global Reach**: An add-on feature that allows you to link your on-premises sites to each other via the Microsoft global network using your ExpressRoute circuits. If you have two different on-premises locations each connected to Azure via ExpressRoute, Global Reach enables them to communicate directly over the Microsoft backbone without routing through your Azure VNet.
* **ExpressRoute Direct**: For customers who need extremely high bandwidth (10 Gbps or 100 Gbps) and direct connectivity into the Microsoft global backbone at peering locations. This bypasses the need for an ExpressRoute connectivity provider.
* **Virtual Network Gateway (ExpressRoute)**: A specific type of VNet Gateway deployed in your `GatewaySubnet` that acts as the entry point for ExpressRoute traffic into your Azure VNet. It's different from a VPN Gateway.

ExpressRoute provides a robust and reliable solution for enterprise-grade connectivity to Azure and Microsoft's global services, essential for hybrid cloud strategies requiring high performance and low latency.
