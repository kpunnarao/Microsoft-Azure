# Introduction to Microsoft Azure:

**Microsoft Azure** (often simply called **Azure**) is a comprehensive cloud computing platform provided by Microsoft. 

It's a vast collection of integrated cloud services that developers and IT professionals use to build, deploy, manage, and run applications and services through a global network of Microsoft-managed data centers. ‚òÅÔ∏è

Launched in 2010, Azure has grown to become one of the leading cloud providers, offering a wide range of capabilities across various categories, including computing, networking, storage, databases, analytics, artificial intelligence, IoT, and more. 

It supports various programming languages, tools, and frameworks, making it a flexible platform for diverse workloads.

## Key Aspects of Microsoft Azure

### Global Infrastructure üåç
Azure's infrastructure is globally distributed, consisting of **regions** (geographical areas containing one or more data centers) and **availability zones** (physically separate locations within a region that have independent power, cooling, and networking). 

This extensive network allows organizations to deploy applications closer to their users for lower latency and to build highly available and disaster-resilient solutions.

### Service Models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) üèóÔ∏èüõ†Ô∏èüìß
As discussed, Azure offers services across all three major cloud computing models:

* **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. Examples include **Azure Virtual Machines (VMs)** for hosting Windows or Linux servers, **Azure Storage** for various data types, and **Azure Virtual Network** for secure network isolation. With IaaS, Microsoft manages the hardware and virtualization, while you manage the operating system, applications, and data.
* **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: Offers a complete development and deployment environment. Examples include **Azure App Service** for hosting web applications, **Azure SQL Database** for managed relational databases, and **Azure Functions** for serverless computing. With PaaS, Microsoft manages the underlying infrastructure, operating system, and middleware, allowing you to focus purely on your application code and data.
* **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: Delivers ready-to-use software applications over the internet. While Azure is primarily a platform for building, it also integrates seamlessly with Microsoft's SaaS offerings like **Microsoft 365** and **Dynamics 365**, where Microsoft manages everything from the application to the underlying infrastructure.

### Core Service Categories and Examples üõ†Ô∏è

Azure provides over 200 products and services, typically categorized as:

* **Compute**:
    * **Virtual Machines (VMs)**: On-demand, scalable computing capacity.
    * **Azure App Service**: Fully managed platform for building, deploying, and scaling web apps, mobile backends, and RESTful APIs.
    * **Azure Functions**: Serverless compute service for running small pieces of code without managing infrastructure.
    * **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**: Managed Kubernetes for deploying and managing containerized applications.
* **Networking**:
    * **Virtual Network (VNet)**: Secure, isolated networks within Azure for your resources.
    * **Load Balancer / Application Gateway**: Distribute traffic across multiple servers for high availability and performance.
    * **VPN Gateway / ExpressRoute**: Securely connect your on-premises networks to Azure.
    * **Network Security Groups (NSGs)**: Filter network traffic to and from Azure resources.
* **Storage**:
