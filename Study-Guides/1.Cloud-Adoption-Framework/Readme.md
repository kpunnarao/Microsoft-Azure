# ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure

The CAF is a structured and strategic approach to successfully adopt cloud technologies while aligning IT goals with business outcomes.

It's less about techenical specifics and more about process, people and business alignment.

This guide outlines each stage of the Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF), including workload guidance based on best practices.
