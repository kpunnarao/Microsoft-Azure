# Azure Portal Navigation and Customization:

The **Azure Portal** is your primary web-based interface for managing all your Azure resources.

Understanding its layout and how to customize it is key to efficient cloud management.

## Azure Portal Navigation üß≠

When you log into the Azure Portal ([portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com)), you'll find a consistent layout designed for ease of use.

### 1. Home Screen / Dashboard üè†
* The **Home screen** is the default view when you sign in. It offers quick access to commonly used services, recently visited resources, and helpful links like the Azure Quickstart Center.
* **Dashboards** are customizable views that allow you to pin resources, metrics, and charts relevant to your work. You can have multiple dashboards, making it easy to monitor different projects or environments.

### 2. Left-Hand Portal Menu ‚ò∞
This is your main navigation hub, typically appearing as a sidebar.
* **Create a resource**: A prominent button or link to quickly access the Azure Marketplace and deploy new services.
* **Favorites**: A customizable list of your most frequently used services. You can add or remove services from this list by clicking the star icon next to a service name.
* **All services**: Provides a comprehensive, categorized list of all services available in Azure. You can use the search bar within this section to quickly find specific services.
* **Resource groups**: Directly navigate to your resource groups, which logically organize your Azure resources.
* **All resources**: Shows a flat list of all resources across all your subscriptions, with filtering options.
* You can toggle the menu between **Flyout** mode (hidden until you click the menu icon) and **Docked** mode (always visible) using the menu icon at the top left.

### 3. Global Header (Top Bar) üîù
This bar provides universal controls and information, always present at the top of the screen.
* **Global Search Bar üîç**: A powerful tool to quickly find resources, services, documentation, or marketplace items. Just start typing!
* **Cloud Shell ‚òÅÔ∏è**: Launches a browser-based command-line interface (CLI) for Bash or PowerShell, allowing you to run scripts directly within the portal.
* **Notifications üîî**: Displays alerts, status updates, and messages about your Azure activities, such as successful deployments or service health issues.
* **Settings ‚öôÔ∏è**: Allows you to customize various portal preferences, including theme, language, and default startup view.
* **Support + Troubleshooting ‚ùì**: Provides quick links to Azure help, documentation, and allows you to open support requests.
* **Your Account üë§**: Shows your logged-in account information, allows you to switch between Azure Active Directory (Microsoft Entra ID) directories, and sign out.

### 4. Resource Blades / Panes üìÑ
When you click on a service or resource, a new vertical pane, often called a "blade," opens.
* This blade displays all the relevant information, settings, and management options for that specific resource.
* For example, if you click on a Virtual Machine, its blade will show its overview, size, networking, disks, monitoring, and other configurations.
* You can open multiple blades simultaneously, and they stack from left to right, allowing you to easily navigate back to previous views using the breadcrumbs at the top of the blade.

## Azure Portal Customization ‚ú®

The Azure Portal is highly customizable to help you tailor your experience and improve productivity.

### 1. Customize Dashboards üé®
Your **Dashboard** is perhaps the most powerful customization feature.
* **Create New Dashboards**: You can create multiple custom dashboards for different projects, teams, or environments.
    * From the Portal Menu, select **Dashboard**.
    * Click **"+ Create"** then **"Custom"** or **"Blank dashboard"**.
* **Add/Remove/Resize Tiles**:
    * Click **"Edit"** on your dashboard.
    * Use the **Tile Gallery** on the left to drag and drop pre-defined tiles (e.g., "All Resources," "Service Health," "Metrics charts," "Resource Groups").
    * Many resources (like VMs, storage accounts, or charts within their monitoring blades) have a **"Pin" icon üìå** (often next to their name or in their command bar). Clicking this allows you to pin that specific resource or chart directly to your current dashboard.
    * Drag tiles around to rearrange them.
    * Resize tiles by dragging their bottom-right corner (if resizable).
* **Configure Tile Settings**: Some tiles allow you to customize their content, title, or filters by clicking the ellipsis (...) or gear icon on the tile.
* **Share Dashboards**: You can choose to make your dashboards **private** (only visible to you) or **share** them with others in your organization. Shared dashboards are Azure resources themselves and can be managed with RBAC.

### 2. Customize Favorites in the Portal Menu ‚≠ê
* Hover over any service in the "All services" list or directly from a service's blade.
* Click the **star icon** next to its name to add it to your "Favorites" list in the left-hand Portal Menu.
* You can then drag and drop favorites within the list to reorder them.

### 3. Portal Settings ‚öôÔ∏è
Click the **gear icon** in the global header to access portal settings:
* **Appearance + startup views**:
    * **Menu behavior**: Choose between **"Flyout"** (collapsed by default) or **"Docked"** (always visible).
    * **Theme**: Select between **"Light"**, **"Dark"**, or **"High contrast"** themes for visual preference.
    * **Startup view**: Choose whether you want the portal to open to the **"Home"** screen or a specific **"Dashboard"** when you sign in.
* **Language + region**: Change the display language of the portal and regional format settings.
* **My information**: View your user details and manage things like exporting or deleting user settings.

### 4. Filters (Subscription, Directory) üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
* If you have access to multiple Azure subscriptions or Azure Active Directory (Microsoft Entra ID) tenants (directories), you can use the **Directory + subscription filter** (often found near your account icon or in the Portal Menu).
* This allows you to filter which subscriptions and directories are visible in your portal view, helping to reduce clutter and focus on relevant resources.

By leveraging these navigation features and customization options, you can make the Azure Portal a highly personalized and efficient workspace for managing your cloud resources.
