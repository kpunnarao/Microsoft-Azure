# Lab: Creating an Azure Account and Subscription üöÄ

This lab guides you through the process of signing up for a Microsoft Azure account and setting up your first subscription. 

This is the foundational step before you can deploy any resources in Azure.

## Lab Scenario üè∞

You need an Azure account to begin exploring and utilizing Azure's cloud services. This lab will cover:

* Signing up for a **Free Azure account**.
* Understanding the relationship between an Azure account and a **subscription**.
* Verifying your subscription details.

## Part 1: Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need:

* A **Microsoft account** (e.g., Outlook.com, Hotmail.com, Live.com, or a Microsoft-associated GitHub account). If you don't have one, you can create one during the Azure sign-up process.
* A **phone number** for verification.
* A **credit card** for identity verification. Azure's free account typically includes a credit for the first 30 days and access to certain free services for 12 months, but a credit card is required for identity verification and to enable pay-as-you-go if you exceed free limits. **You will not be charged unless you explicitly upgrade to a paid subscription.**

## Part 2: Creating Your Azure Account

The most common way to start is with an Azure Free Account, which gives you a great way to explore Azure services without immediate cost.

### Steps to Create an Azure Free Account üåê

1.  **Open your web browser** and navigate to the Azure Free Account sign-up page:
    [**https://azure.microsoft.com/free/**](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)

2.  Click the **"Start free"** button.

3.  **Sign in with your Microsoft account**. If you don't have one, you'll be prompted to create one. Follow the on-screen instructions to set up your Microsoft account (if needed).

4.  **Provide your personal information**:
    * You'll be asked for country/region, name, email address, and phone number.
    * **Phone Verification**: You will likely receive a verification code via SMS to the phone number you provided. Enter this code to proceed.

5.  **Identity Verification (Credit Card)**:
    * Enter your credit card details. This is primarily for **identity verification** to ensure you're not a robot and to prevent abuse.
    * Microsoft clearly states: "We won't charge you for services until you explicitly move to pay-as-you-go pricing."
    * Sometimes, a small, temporary authorization charge (e.g., $1 USD) might appear on your card, which is immediately reversed. This is a common practice to verify the card.

6.  **Agree to the Subscription Agreement**:
    * Review the Microsoft Customer Agreement, privacy statement, and subscription details. Check the box to agree.

7.  Click **"Sign up"**.

8.  **Welcome to Azure!**: After a brief processing time, you'll be redirected to the Azure Portal. You'll likely see a welcome screen or a notification about your new Azure Free Account.

## Part 3: Understanding Your Azure Subscription

When you create an Azure account, you automatically get at least one **Azure subscription**. A subscription is a logical container for your Azure services and resources.

* **Billing Boundary**: It acts as a billing unit. All the resources you deploy (like VMs, storage accounts, databases) within a subscription are billed together to the associated account.
* **Security Boundary**: It also acts as a security boundary, allowing you to manage access to resources within that subscription using Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
* **Service Limits**: Subscriptions often have default service limits or quotas (e.g., a certain number of VMs you can deploy in a region).

### Verifying Your Subscription in the Azure Portal üåê

1.  Once you are in the Azure Portal ([portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com)), you can find your subscription details.
2.  In the left-hand navigation pane, search for or click on **"Subscriptions"**.
3.  You should see your newly created subscription, typically named something like **"Azure subscription 1"** or **"Azure Free Trial"**.
4.  Click on the subscription name to view its details, including:
    * **Subscription ID**: A unique identifier for your subscription.
    * **Subscription name**: The display name of your subscription.
    * **Status**: Indicates if it's active.
    * **Offer**: (e.g., Azure Free Account, Pay-As-You-Go, Visual Studio Enterprise subscription). This specifies the terms and pricing.
    * **Cost analysis**: A link to monitor your spending.

Congratulations! You now have an active Azure account and a subscription. This is your gateway to exploring all the services Azure has to offer.

* Familiarize yourself with the **Azure Portal**.
* Review the details of your **Azure Free Account** to understand the credits and free services available.
* You are now ready to start deploying your first Azure resources!
