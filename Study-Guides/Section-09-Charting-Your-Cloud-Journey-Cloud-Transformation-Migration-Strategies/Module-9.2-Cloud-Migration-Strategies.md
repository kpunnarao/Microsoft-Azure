### **☁️ Module 9.2: Cloud Migration Strategies - The 6 R's**

Choosing the right migration strategy for each application and workload is a critical decision in your cloud journey. 

This decision impacts effort, cost, timelines, and the ultimate benefits you derive from the cloud. 

The "6 R's" is a widely recognized framework that helps organizations categorize and decide on the best approach for each asset in their digital estate.

#### **I. Introduction to the 6 R's of Cloud Migration**

The "6 R's" framework provides a structured way to think about portfolio rationalization and determine the disposition of applications and infrastructure during a cloud migration. 

It was originally coined by AWS, but the principles are universally applicable across all cloud providers, including Azure.

The 6 R's are:

1.  **Rehost** (Lift and Shift)
2.  **Replatform** (Lift, Tinker, and Shift)
3.  **Rearchitect**
4.  **Rebuild** (or Re-factor/Rewrite)
5.  **Repurchase** (Drop and Shop)
6.  **Retain**
7.  **Retire**

While sometimes presented as 5 or 7 Rs (with "Re-factor" often combined with "Rearchitect" or "Rebuild," and "Retire" and "Retain" sometimes separated), the core concepts remain consistent. We'll use the common 6-R framework including Rehost, Replatform, Rearchitect, Repurchase, Retire, and Retain.

#### **II. Detailed Explanation of Each Strategy**

Let's delve into each strategy, its characteristics, advantages, disadvantages, and typical use cases.

**1. Rehost (Lift and Shift)**

* **Definition:** Moving an application and its underlying infrastructure (e.g., virtual machines, databases) from an on-premises environment to the cloud with minimal or no changes to the application's architecture or code. It's like moving your furniture from one house to another without redesigning the rooms.
* **Characteristics:**
    * Focuses on IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service).
    * High automation potential using migration tools.
    * No application code changes.
* **Advantages:**
    * **Fastest and Simplest:** Offers the quickest path to the cloud.
    * **Lower Initial Cost/Effort:** Requires less upfront investment in re-engineering.
    * **Low Risk:** Minimizes disruption to application functionality.
    * **Builds Cloud Experience:** Allows teams to gain operational experience in the cloud.
* **Disadvantages:**
    * **Limited Cloud Optimization:** Doesn't fully leverage cloud-native features (e.g., managed services, serverless).
    * **Potential for Inefficiency:** May inherit inefficiencies (over-provisioning, legacy licenses) from on-premises.
    * **Technical Debt Carried Over:** Existing performance or reliability issues are not resolved.
* **Typical Use Cases:**
    * Applications with no immediate business need for modernization.
    * Large-scale migrations under tight deadlines (e.g., datacenter exit).
    * Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) applications where code modification is not allowed.
    * Building initial cloud operational experience for teams.
* **Azure Examples:** Migrating on-premises VMs directly to Azure VMs, moving SQL Server databases to SQL Server on Azure VMs.
* **Tools:** Azure Migrate (Server Migration, Database Migration), Azure Site Recovery.

**2. Replatform (Lift, Tinker, and Shift)**

* **Definition:** Moving an application to the cloud, making some minor cloud-specific optimizations to achieve tangible benefits, without changing the core architecture. It's like moving to a new house and doing some minor renovations (e.g., painting, changing light fixtures) but not knocking down walls.
* **Characteristics:**
    * Mix of IaaS and PaaS (Platform as a Service).
    * Some configuration or runtime changes, but minimal code changes.
    * Aims for quick wins in terms of cost, performance, or operational overhead.
* **Advantages:**
    * **Improved Efficiency:** Achieves some cloud benefits (e.g., reduced patching, easier scaling) without major re-engineering.
    * **Faster Time to Value:** Quicker than rearchitecting, but yields more benefits than a pure rehost.
    * **Reduced Operational Overhead:** Offloads infrastructure management to the cloud provider (e.g., managed databases).
* **Disadvantages:**
    * **Still Not Fully Cloud-Native:** May not fully exploit all cloud-native capabilities.
    * **Some Effort Required:** More complex than rehosting due to changes.
* **Typical Use Cases:**
    * Applications that can easily adapt to managed services (e.g., shifting SQL Server to Azure SQL Database Managed Instance).
    * Applications needing quick performance boosts or reduced operational burden.
    * Web applications moving from IaaS VMs to Azure App Service with minimal code changes.
* **Azure Examples:** Migrating on-premises SQL Server to Azure SQL Database (PaaS), moving an application from an IaaS VM to Azure App Service (PaaS) with minor configuration tweaks, using Azure Cache for Redis instead of self-managed Redis.
* **Tools:** Azure Migrate (Database Migration, Web Apps Migration), Azure Database Migration Service.

**3. Rearchitect**

* **Definition:** Fundamentally altering an application's architecture to fully leverage cloud-native capabilities and optimize for scalability, resilience, agility, and cost. This involves significant code changes. It's like redesigning your house entirely, perhaps adding new rooms or changing its layout to fit your new lifestyle.
* **Characteristics:**
    * Focuses on PaaS, Serverless, Containers, and Microservices.
    * Significant code changes and architectural redesign.
    * High investment in time and resources.
* **Advantages:**
    * **Maximum Cloud Benefits:** Unlocks the full potential of cloud elasticity, scalability, and managed services.
    * **Increased Agility & Innovation:** Enables faster feature development and deployment.
    * **Improved Resilience & Performance:** Designed for cloud-scale reliability and performance.
    * **Long-Term Cost Optimization:** Potentially lower operational costs in the long run.
* **Disadvantages:**
    * **Most Complex & Costly:** Requires significant development effort and specialized skills.
    * **Highest Risk:** Introduces the most risk of disruption during migration.
    * **Longer Timelines:** Takes the most time to complete.
* **Typical Use Cases:**
    * Monolithic applications that are difficult to scale or maintain.
    * Applications with high future growth potential or evolving business requirements.
    * When the current architecture is a bottleneck for innovation or performance.
    * When an application needs to become truly cloud-native (e.g., microservices, serverless functions).
* **Azure Examples:** Decomposing a monolithic .NET application into microservices running on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) or Azure Container Apps, replacing a legacy message queue with Azure Service Bus or Azure Event Hubs, converting batch processes to Azure Functions.

**4. Rebuild (also known as Rewrite / Re-factor)**

* **Definition:** Discarding an existing application and rebuilding it from scratch directly in the cloud, leveraging cloud-native technologies from the ground up. This is often chosen when the existing application is no longer fit for purpose, heavily outdated, or when a new business opportunity demands a fresh start. It's like tearing down an old, dilapidated house and building a brand new one from scratch.
* **Characteristics:**
    * Starting fresh with cloud-native principles.
    * No existing code is reused (or very minimal).
    * Highest investment and longest timeline.
* **Advantages:**
    * **Full Cloud Optimization:** Fully designed for the cloud from day one.
    * **Leverage Latest Tech:** Can incorporate the latest cloud services and architectural patterns.
    * **Eliminates Technical Debt:** No legacy baggage carried forward.
    * **Opportunity for Innovation:** Allows for entirely new functionality and user experiences.
* **Disadvantages:**
    * **Most Expensive & Time-Consuming:** Highest development cost and longest project duration.
    * **High Risk:** Requires significant resources and careful management.
    * **Potential for Feature Parity Issues:** May take time to reach feature parity with the old system.
* **Typical Use Cases:**
    * Applications that are obsolete, difficult to maintain, or provide little business value in their current state.
    * When the cost of rearchitecting outweighs the benefit.
    * To launch a completely new product or service.
    * If the existing technology stack is entirely incompatible or unsupported in the cloud.
* **Azure Examples:** Building a new e-commerce platform from scratch using Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Functions, Azure App Service, and Azure CDN; developing a new IoT solution using Azure IoT Hub, Stream Analytics, and Power BI.

**5. Repurchase (Drop and Shop)**

* **Definition:** Replacing an existing application or service with a cloud-native SaaS (Software as a Service) offering. This involves moving to a new product, often with a different licensing model. It's like deciding not to renovate your old car, but instead, buying a new, cloud-based electric vehicle that fits your needs better.
* **Characteristics:**
    * No migration of application code; simply adopting a new vendor solution.
    * Focus on SaaS.
    * Requires data migration and user training for the new system.
* **Advantages:**
    * **Fastest "Migration" for that workload:** No infrastructure to manage.
    * **Reduced Operational Burden:** Vendor handles all infrastructure, patching, and updates.
    * **Access to Best-in-Class Features:** Leverage specialized functionality from SaaS providers.
    * **Predictable Costs:** Often subscription-based.
* **Disadvantages:**
    * **Vendor Lock-in:** Dependence on the SaaS provider's roadmap and pricing.
    * **Limited Customization:** Less control over features and underlying infrastructure.
    * **Data Migration Complexity:** Moving data from the old system to the new SaaS.
    * **User Retraining:** Requires users to learn a new interface.
* **Typical Use Cases:**
    * Standard business functions (CRM, ERP, HR, email, office productivity) where a pre-built solution exists.
    * Replacing legacy on-premises applications with modern SaaS equivalents (e.g., moving from on-premises Exchange to Microsoft 365, from an in-house CRM to Dynamics 365 or Salesforce).
* **Azure Examples:** Migrating from on-premises SharePoint to SharePoint Online (Microsoft 365), replacing an on-premises BI solution with Power BI, adopting Azure DevOps Services instead of self-hosted TFS.

**6. Retire / Retain**

These two R's address applications that *don't* move to the cloud.

* **Retire:**
    * **Definition:** Decommissioning applications or services that are no longer needed, provide little business value, or are redundant.
    * **Characteristics:** Eliminates associated costs and complexity.
    * **Advantages:** Immediate cost savings, reduced attack surface, simplifies the overall IT portfolio.
    * **Disadvantages:** Requires careful analysis to ensure no hidden dependencies or critical forgotten functionality.
    * **Typical Use Cases:** Applications that are rarely used, duplicated by other systems, or have reached their end-of-life. Part of portfolio rationalization.

* **Retain:**
    * **Definition:** Keeping certain applications or systems in their current on-premises or existing environment, and not migrating them to the cloud at this time.
    * **Characteristics:** Strategic decision to defer migration for specific reasons.
    * **Advantages:** Avoids high migration costs for complex legacy systems, maintains compliance for specific data residency requirements, or for applications with significant sunk costs that are not yet recouped.
    * **Disadvantages:** Misses out on cloud benefits for those specific workloads, potential for continued technical debt, complicates overall IT management (maintaining hybrid environment).
    * **Typical Use Cases:**
        * Applications with extremely low latency requirements.
        * Systems with specific regulatory or compliance constraints that prevent cloud migration.
        * Applications running on specialized hardware that cannot be easily replicated in the cloud.
        * When an application is very complex to migrate, and the return on investment doesn't justify the effort *right now*.
        * When an organization is not ready for a particular application's migration, but plans to revisit it later (often leading to a hybrid cloud model).

#### **III. Choosing the Appropriate Migration Strategy**

The choice of strategy for each application depends on a careful assessment of several factors:

* **Business Drivers:** What are the primary goals? (e.g., speed to market, cost savings, innovation, risk reduction).
* **Application Complexity:** How intricate is the application's architecture? How many interdependencies does it have?
* **Technical Debt:** How old is the technology stack? Is the code maintainable?
* **Budget & Timeline:** How much time and money can be invested?
* **Skills Availability:** Does the team have the expertise for re-engineering or are new skills needed?
* **Compliance & Security Requirements:** Are there specific regulations that dictate where data resides or how applications operate?
* **Future Vision:** What is the long-term strategic value of the application? Does it need to be modernized for future growth?
* **Cost vs. Optimization:** A trade-off between quick wins (Rehost) and long-term optimization/innovation (Rearchitect/Rebuild).

**Decision Flow (Simplified):**

1.  **Is the application needed?**
    * No -> **Retire**
2.  **Can it be replaced by an off-the-shelf SaaS solution?**
    * Yes -> **Repurchase**
3.  **Does it have specific constraints that prevent cloud migration right now?**
    * Yes -> **Retain**
4.  **Does the application have high strategic value and a need for significant modernization/innovation?**
    * Yes -> **Rearchitect** or **Rebuild** (choose Rebuild if existing code/architecture is fundamentally broken or obsolete)
5.  **Can it benefit from minor cloud optimizations (e.g., managed database, PaaS service) without major code changes?**
    * Yes -> **Replatform**
6.  **Does it need to move to the cloud quickly with minimal changes, or is it a COTS app?**
    * Yes -> **Rehost**

It's common for an organization to use a mix of these strategies across its application portfolio. For instance, initial waves might heavily use Rehost for quick wins, followed by Replatforming and then more strategic Rearchitecting for high-value applications.
