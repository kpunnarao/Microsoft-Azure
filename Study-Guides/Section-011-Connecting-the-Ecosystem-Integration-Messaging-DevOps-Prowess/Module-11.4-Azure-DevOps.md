### **üõ†Ô∏è Module 11.4: Azure DevOps - Your End-to-End DevOps Platform**

In **Previous Module**, we introduced the concept of DevOps and its guiding principles. Now, we'll dive into **Azure DevOps**, Microsoft's comprehensive suite of integrated services designed to support the entire software delivery lifecycle, from planning and development to deployment and operations.

Azure DevOps provides a unified platform that brings together development, operations, and quality assurance teams, fostering collaboration and automation to deliver software faster and more reliably. 

It's available as a cloud service (**Azure DevOps Services**) or as an on-premises product (**Azure DevOps Server**, formerly TFS). Our focus here will be on the cloud service.

#### **I. What is Azure DevOps?**

Azure DevOps is a Software as a Service (SaaS) offering that provides an end-to-end toolchain for developing and deploying software. It comprises five core services, each addressing a critical aspect of the DevOps workflow, which can be used independently or together:

1.  **Azure Boards:** For agile planning and work item tracking.
2.  **Azure Repos:** For source code management with Git or TFVC.
3.  **Azure Pipelines:** For Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD).
4.  **Azure Test Plans:** For manual and automated test management.
5.  **Azure Artifacts:** For package management and sharing.

#### **II. Core Services of Azure DevOps**

Let's explore each service in detail:

##### **A. Azure Boards: Agile Project Management**

Azure Boards provides a rich set of Agile tools to plan, track, and discuss work across your teams. It's designed to give a clear view of your project's progress and status, supporting various methodologies.

* **Key Functionalities:**
    * **Work Items:** Customizable units of work to track features, user stories, bugs, tasks, epics, issues, etc. Each work item can contain rich text descriptions, attachments, links to other work items or commits, and a discussion thread.
    * **Backlogs:** Prioritized lists of work items. Product Backlogs for overall features/requirements, and Sprint Backlogs for work planned for specific iterations.
    * **Kanban Boards:** Visual, interactive boards that help teams visualize workflow, limit work in progress (WIP), and maximize flow. Drag-and-drop functionality allows easy status updates.
    * **Sprint Planning & Task Boards:** Tools for planning and executing work in iterations (sprints), including burndown charts and velocity tracking to monitor progress.
    * **Queries:** Create custom queries to filter and group work items, allowing you to generate reports and dashboards tailored to specific needs (e.g., "all active bugs assigned to me").
    * **Dashboards:** Customizable dashboards with widgets to visualize project status, team velocity, burndown/burnup charts, test results, and more.
    * **Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with Azure Repos (linking work items to commits/pull requests) and Azure Pipelines (linking work items to builds/releases). Also integrates with external tools like GitHub (for linking PRs/commits) and Microsoft Teams/Slack.
* **Benefits:** Enhanced collaboration, improved transparency, better prioritization, adaptable to various Agile methodologies (Scrum, Kanban).

##### **B. Azure Repos: Source Code Management**

Azure Repos provides highly scalable, private Git repositories or Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC) for managing your source code. Git is the default and recommended choice for modern development.

* **Key Functionalities:**
    * **Git Repositories:**
        * **Distributed Version Control:** Each developer has a complete local copy of the repository, enabling offline work and faster branching/merging.
        * **Unlimited Private Repositories:** Host as many private Git repos as needed.
        * **Pull Requests (PRs):** A mechanism for code review where developers propose changes, and team members review, discuss, and approve them before merging into a main branch.
        * **Branch Policies:** Enforce quality gates on branches (e.g., requiring code reviews, successful builds, specific reviewers) to maintain code quality in critical branches.
        * **Code Search:** Easily search across all your Git repositories.
    * **TFVC (Team Foundation Version Control):**
        * **Centralized Version Control:** Files are checked out from a central server, and changes are checked back in.
        * **File Locking:** Supports exclusive locks on files to prevent conflicts (though less common with modern Git workflows).
        * **Large Binary Files:** Often preferred for very large binary files and legacy projects where a centralized model is beneficial.
* **Benefits:** Robust version control, enhanced code collaboration through PRs, improved code quality via branch policies, choice between distributed (Git) and centralized (TFVC) models.

##### **C. Azure Pipelines: Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)**

Azure Pipelines is a cloud-native CI/CD service that automatically builds, tests, and deploys your code to any platform or cloud, including Azure, AWS, GCP, or on-premises.

* **Key Functionalities:**
    * **Continuous Integration (CI):**
        * **Automated Builds:** Automatically compiles code, runs unit tests, and produces artifacts whenever code is pushed to the repository (or on a schedule).
        * **Multi-Platform Support:** Supports a wide range of languages and platforms (Node.js, Python, Java, .NET, C++, Go, iOS, Android) and various build systems.
        * **YAML Pipelines (Pipelines as Code):** Define your CI/CD pipelines directly in YAML files stored alongside your code, enabling version control, code reviews, and reproducibility for your pipeline definitions.
        * **Hosted Agents:** Microsoft-hosted build agents provide a fully managed, scalable infrastructure for your builds across Windows, Linux, and macOS.
        * **Self-Hosted Agents:** Deploy agents on your own infrastructure for builds requiring specific environments or access to on-premises resources.
    * **Continuous Delivery (CD):**
        * **Automated Deployments:** Automatically deploys validated builds to various environments (dev, test, staging, production).
        * **Multi-Stage Pipelines:** Organize releases into logical stages with dependencies, approvals, and gates.
        * **Deployment Gates:** Define conditions that must be met before a deployment can proceed (e.g., approval from a manager, successful health checks).
        * **Environment Management:** Define and manage deployment environments, including security and approval settings.
        * **Integration with Release Tools:** Deploy to Azure resources (Web Apps, VMs, AKS, Functions), Kubernetes, virtual machines, container registries, or any custom target via custom scripts or tasks.
