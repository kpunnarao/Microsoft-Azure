## **🌐 Module 2.5: Azure DNS (Public & Private Zones) Deep Dive**

The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network. 

It translates human-friendly domain names (like `www.example.com`) into numerical IP addresses (like `192.0.2.1`) that computers use to identify each other. 

Azure DNS provides a highly available and reliable DNS hosting service for your domains, offering both public-facing and private, internal name resolution capabilities.

#### **What is Azure DNS?**

Azure DNS is a hosting service for DNS domains that provides name resolution using Microsoft Azure infrastructure. 

By hosting your domains in Azure, you can manage your DNS records using the same credentials, APIs, tools, and billing as your other Azure services. 

Azure DNS provides both Public DNS Zones for internet-facing domains and Private DNS Zones for internal, virtual network resolution.

#### **Azure Public DNS Zones**

Azure Public DNS Zones are used to host the DNS records for domains that are accessible and resolvable over the public internet. 

These are the DNS zones for your public websites, mail servers, and any other internet-facing services.

* **Purpose and Core Functionality:**
    * **Host Public Domains:** Manages DNS records for domain names that are accessible globally over the internet.
    * **High Availability & Performance:** Domains hosted in Azure Public DNS are served by Azure's global network of DNS name servers using Anycast networking. This means DNS queries are answered by the closest available DNS server, providing fast performance and high availability.
    * **Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with other Azure services like Public IP addresses, Traffic Manager profiles, and Azure CDN endpoints through Alias records.
    * **Security:** Built on Azure Resource Manager, providing RBAC, activity logs, and resource locking. Supports DNSSEC for added security.

* **Key Components of a Public DNS Zone:**
    1.  **DNS Zone:** A container for all the DNS records for a specific domain name (e.g., `contoso.com`). When you create a public DNS zone in Azure DNS, you are hosting that domain's records within Azure.
    2.  **Record Sets (Resource Records):** Individual entries within a DNS zone that map a domain name to specific values (e.g., an IP address). A record set can contain multiple records of the same type (e.g., multiple A records for load balancing).
        * **A (Address) Record:** Maps a domain name (or subdomain) to an IPv4 address.
            * *Example:* `www.contoso.com` -> `203.0.113.1`
        * **AAAA (IPv6 Address) Record:** Maps a domain name to an IPv6 address.
            * *Example:* `www.contoso.com` -> `2001:0db8::1`
        * **CNAME (Canonical Name) Record:** Creates an alias from one domain name to another canonical domain name. The CNAME points to another domain name, not directly to an IP address.
            * *Example:* `blog.contoso.com` -> `contosoblog.azurewebsites.net`
        * **MX (Mail Exchange) Record:** Specifies the mail servers responsible for accepting email messages on behalf of a domain name. Includes a preference number (lower is preferred).
            * *Example:* `contoso.com` -> `10 mail.contoso.com`
        * **TXT (Text) Record:** Stores arbitrary text information, often used for email validation (e.g., SPF, DKIM) or site verification.
            * *Example:* `contoso.com` -> `"v=spf1 include:spf.protection.outlook.com -all"`
        * **SRV (Service) Record:** Specifies a host and port for specific services (e.g., SIP, XMPP, LDAP). Used for service discovery.
            * *Example:* `_sip._tcp.contoso.com` -> `10 60 5060 sipserver.contoso.com`
        * **NS (Name Server) Record:** Specifies the authoritative DNS name servers for a zone. When you delegate your domain to Azure DNS, you update NS records at your domain registrar.
        * **SOA (Start of Authority) Record:** Contains administrative information about the zone, such as the primary name server, the email of the zone administrator, and various timers. Automatically created for every zone.
    3.  **Name Servers (NS Records):** When you create a Public DNS Zone, Azure assigns a set of authoritative name servers (e.g., `ns1-01.azure-dns.com`). You must update your domain registrar to point your domain to these Azure-provided name servers to delegate your domain to Azure DNS.
    4.  **TTL (Time-to-Live):** The duration (in seconds) that DNS resolvers are allowed to cache a record. A lower TTL means changes propagate faster but result in more DNS queries. A higher TTL means slower propagation but fewer queries.
    5.  **Alias Records:** A special record type in Azure DNS that can point to an Azure resource (e.g., a Public IP address, a Traffic Manager profile, a CDN endpoint, an App Service). If the IP address of the underlying Azure resource changes, the alias record automatically updates during DNS resolution. This is particularly useful for mapping your apex domain (e.g., `contoso.com`) to an Azure resource that might not have a static IP or requires CNAME flattening at the apex.

* **Benefits of Using Public DNS Zones:**
    * **Global Reach & Performance:** Leveraging Azure's global DNS infrastructure ensures low latency and high availability for public DNS resolution.
    * **Simplified Management:** Manage your public DNS alongside your other Azure resources in a single control plane.
    * **Cost-Effective:** Pay only for the zones hosted and the number of DNS queries received.
    * **Resilience:** Anycast routing provides automatic failover across Azure's global DNS servers.
    * **DNSSEC Support:** Adds a layer of security by authenticating DNS responses, protecting against DNS spoofing and cache poisoning attacks.

* **Common Use Cases for Public DNS Zones:**
    * **Hosting Public Websites:** Mapping your website domain (e.g., `www.yourcompany.com`) to your Azure Web App, VM, or Load Balancer.
    * **Email Services:** Configuring MX and TXT records for your organization's email services.
    * **API Endpoints:** Exposing public API endpoints with custom domain names.
    * **Global Traffic Management Integration:** Using alias records to point your domain to an Azure Traffic Manager profile or Front Door instance for global traffic distribution.

#### **Azure Private DNS Zones**

Azure Private DNS Zones provide a reliable and secure DNS service for your virtual networks. They allow you to use your own custom domain names within your virtual networks without the need to configure a custom DNS solution or manage DNS servers. Records in a private DNS zone are *not* resolvable from the public internet.

* **Purpose and Core Functionality:**
    * **Internal Name Resolution:** Manages and resolves domain names for Azure resources (VMs, Private Endpoints, etc.) within one or more Azure virtual networks.
    * **Removes Custom DNS Overhead:** Eliminates the need to deploy and manage your own DNS servers (e.g., Windows Server DNS VMs) for internal name resolution within Azure.
    * **Split-Horizon DNS:** Enables you to have the same domain name (e.g., `contoso.com`) resolve to different IP addresses depending on whether the query originates from within your linked virtual network (private IP) or the internet (public IP).
    * **Automatic Hostname Registration:** Can automatically register DNS records for VMs deployed in a virtual network linked for "registration" to the private zone.
    * **Cross-VNet Resolution:** Allows name resolution between virtual networks that are linked to the same private DNS zone, even if those VNets are not peered.
    * **Private Link Integration:** Crucial for resolving the FQDNs of Azure PaaS services (e.g., Azure SQL Database, Storage Accounts, Key Vault) to their private IP addresses when using Private Endpoints.

* **Key Components of a Private DNS Zone:**
    1.  **Private DNS Zone:** A container for DNS records that is scoped to one or more Azure virtual networks. Its data is stored as a global resource, meaning it's not tied to a single VNet or region.
    2.  **Record Sets:** Similar to Public DNS Zones, Private DNS Zones support common record types like A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, TXT, SRV. PTR (Pointer) records for reverse DNS are also supported within the linked VNet scope.
    3.  **Virtual Network Links:**
        * **Description:** A link connects a Private DNS Zone to one or more virtual networks. This link allows VMs and other resources within the linked VNet(s) to query and resolve records in that private DNS zone.
        * **Types of Links:**
            * **Registration VNet Link (with Autoregistration enabled):** Only one VNet can be linked to a private zone with autoregistration enabled. When enabled, Azure automatically creates and removes A records for VMs (mapping VM name to private IP) within that VNet in the private zone. This is ideal for scenarios where you want automatic DNS lifecycle management for your VMs.
            * **Resolution VNet Link (Autoregistration disabled):** Multiple VNets (up to 1000) can be linked to a single private zone for resolution purposes. VMs in these VNets can resolve records in the private zone, but their own records are *not* automatically registered.
    4.  **Automatic Registration:** When enabled on a Virtual Network Link, Azure automatically registers (as A records) and deregisters hostnames of VMs deployed in the linked virtual network into the private DNS zone, mapping them to their private IP addresses. This eliminates manual DNS record management for VMs.

* **Benefits of Using Private DNS Zones:**
    * **Simplified DNS Management:** No need to deploy and manage DNS server VMs for internal name resolution.
    * **Custom Domain Names:** Use your own custom domain names for internal resources (e.g., `app.internal.contoso.com`).
    * **Enhanced Security:** Records are not exposed to the public internet, improving your security posture.
    * **Seamless Integration:** Works natively with Azure Virtual Networks and Private Endpoints.
    * **Cross-VNet Resolution:** Enables name resolution across peered or non-peered virtual networks without complex forwarding rules.
    * **Split-Horizon DNS Support:** Manage distinct internal and external views of your domain within Azure DNS.

* **Common Use Cases for Private DNS Zones:**
    * **Internal Application Communication:** Resolving internal FQDNs for multi-tier applications within a VNet (e.g., `dbserver.backend.local`).
    * **Hybrid Cloud Resolution:** Resolving Azure resource names from on-premises networks (often in conjunction with Azure DNS Private Resolver).
    * **Private Endpoint Resolution:** Crucial for resolving the FQDNs of Azure PaaS services (e.g., `storacc.privatelink.blob.core.windows.net`) to their private IPs when using Private Link.
    * **Centralized DNS for Hub-and-Spoke:** Linking a central Private DNS Zone to a hub VNet (for registration) and spoke VNets (for resolution) to provide consistent internal name resolution across your network topology.
    * **Development/Test Environments:** Creating isolated internal DNS namespaces for different environments using the same application names.

#### **Advanced Scenarios: Hybrid DNS Resolution & Split-Horizon DNS**

* **Hybrid DNS Resolution:**
    * **Challenge:** How do on-premises resources resolve names in Azure Private DNS Zones, and how do Azure resources resolve names in on-premises DNS?
    * **Solution (Azure DNS Private Resolver):** This dedicated service enables seamless DNS resolution between Azure virtual networks and on-premises environments without deploying VM-based DNS servers.
        * **Inbound Endpoint:** Provides an IP address in your VNet that on-premises DNS servers can conditionally forward queries to for Azure Private DNS Zones.
        * **Outbound Endpoint + Forwarding Ruleset:** Allows Azure resources to forward queries for on-premises domains to on-premises DNS servers.
        * **Traditional Method (Custom DNS Servers):** Before the Private Resolver, customers often deployed Windows Server VMs running DNS in Azure, configured with conditional forwarders to bridge resolution between Azure and on-premises. This still works but adds management overhead.
    * **Principle:** For on-premises to Azure, you configure conditional forwarders on your on-premises DNS servers to forward queries for your Azure private domain (e.g., `*.internal.contoso.com`) to the IP of the Azure DNS Private Resolver's inbound endpoint (or custom DNS VM). For Azure to on-premises, you configure DNS settings on your Azure VNet to point to the Private Resolver's outbound endpoint (or custom DNS VM), and the resolver has rules to forward on-premises domain queries.

* **Split-Horizon DNS (or Split-Brain DNS):**
    * **Concept:** Providing different DNS answers for the same domain name depending on whether the query originates from an internal (private) network or the external (public) internet.
    * **Implementation in Azure:** This is achieved by having:
        1.  A **Public DNS Zone** (e.g., `contoso.com`) for external resolution, pointing public clients to public IPs (e.g., `www.contoso.com` -> public IP of a web server).
        2.  A **Private DNS Zone** with the *same name* (e.g., `contoso.com`) linked to your Azure VNet(s) for internal resolution, pointing internal clients to private IPs (e.g., `www.contoso.com` -> private IP of the same web server's internal load balancer).
    * **Benefit:** Allows internal applications to access resources using their private IPs (more efficient, secure) while external users access the same resource using its public IP, all under the same FQDN. This simplifies application configuration and user experience.
    * **Example:** A web application `mywebapp.contoso.com`
        * From the internet: resolves to a Public IP via the Public DNS Zone.
        * From within your Azure VNet: resolves to a Private IP (e.g., of an internal load balancer) via the Private DNS Zone.
