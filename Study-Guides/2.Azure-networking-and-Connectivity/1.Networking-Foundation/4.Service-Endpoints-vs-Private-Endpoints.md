# Service Endpoints vs Private Endpoints:

It's a very common point of confusion in Azure networking, and rightly so, as both Service Endpoints and Private Endpoints aim to provide secure connectivity to Azure PaaS services. However, their underlying mechanisms and the level of isolation they offer are fundamentally different.

Here's a detailed comparison of Service Endpoints vs. Private Endpoints:

## Service Endpoints:

**What they are:**

* Service Endpoints extend your Virtual Network's (VNet) private address space and identity to Azure PaaS services. 

* This allows you to restrict network access to your Azure service resources to only traffic originating from specified subnets within your Azure VNets.

## Private Endpoints

**What they are:**

* Private Endpoints create a dedicated private IP address for a specific Azure PaaS service resource directly within your Virtual Network. 

* This effectively "brings" the Azure service into your VNet, making it accessible as if it were a resource hosted natively in your private network.

* They are powered by Azure Private Link.

## Key Differences Summary:

| Feature |	Service Endpoints |	Private Endpoints |
|---------| ------------------| ------------------|
|Connectivity| Connects to the public endpoint of the service, but traffic uses Azure backbone. | Creates a private IP address for the service in your VNet; traffic is fully private.|
| IP Address | Service retains its public IP; VNet traffic uses private source IP. | Service gets a private IP from your VNet; public access can be disabled.|
| Public Internet| Traffic from VNet doesn't traverse public internet, but service endpoint is still publicly routable.| Traffic is completely private and never leaves the Microsoft backbone.|
| Scope of Access|Configured at the subnet level; applies to service type in a region. | Configured at the resource level; applies to a specific instance of a service.|
|On-Premises Access| No direct private access from on-premises.	| Yes, supports private access from on-premises via VPN/ExpressRoute.|
|DNS Resolution| Resolves to public IP; private routing happens at network layer.| Resolves to private IP (via Private DNS Zone or custom DNS).|
|Cost| Generally free.| Incurs costs (hourly + data processing).|
|Granularity| Less granular (service type). Service Endpoint Policies for Storage can add more.| Highly granular (specific resource instance).| 
|UDR Bypass| Yes, Service Endpoint routes take precedence over UDRs.| No, traffic is directed to the private IP within the VNet, respecting UDRs.|
|Complexity| Simpler to configure.| More complex, especially with custom DNS.|

In essence, if you need the highest level of network isolation, want to disable public access entirely, or need to connect from on-premises privately, Private Endpoints are the way to go. 

If your requirements are simpler, focused on keeping Azure VNet traffic off the public internet for specific PaaS services, and you can tolerate the service having a public endpoint (albeit firewall-protected), Service Endpoints offer a cost-effective and easy-to-configure solution.
