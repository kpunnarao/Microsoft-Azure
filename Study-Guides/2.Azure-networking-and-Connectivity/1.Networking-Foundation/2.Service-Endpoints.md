# Service Endpoints & Private Endpoints:

## Service Endpoints:

* Service Endpoints extend your Virtual Network's(VNet) private address space to Azure services, allowing traffic to traverse  the Azure backbone network instead of the public internet. 

* However, the Azure service still retains its Public IP address, and traffic effectively uses that Public IP, even though it's optimized within Azure's network. 

* service endpoints are Configured on Subnet Level and apply to all instances of a specific Azure service in a given region.

## How Azure Service Endpoints Work:

* Service endpoints essentially "tell" an Azure service that traffic from a specific subnet in your VNet is a trusted source.

* When you enable a service endpoint for a subnet to an Azure Service (like Azure Storage or Azure SQL Database), the source IP address of traffic from that subnet when communicating with the service switches from using the public IP address  of your VM to its `Private IP Address`. 

* The traffic then travels directly over the `Azure backbone network` to the Azure Service's public endpoint, rather than going ove the internet.

When you enable a Service Endpoint for a specific Azure service on a subnet within your VNet:

**Extended VNet Identity:**

* The VNet's identity is extended to the Azure service. 
    
* This allows the Azure service to identify traffic coming from that specific VNet and subnet.

**Optimized Routing:**

* Traffic from the enabled subnet to the Azure service no longer goes through the public internet. 
    
* Instead, it takes a direct, optimized route over the Azure backbone network. 
    
* This reduces latency and improves performance.

**Source IP Change:**

* When traffic originates from a VM in the subnet with the Service Endpoint enabled, the source IP address for that traffic, when it reaches the Azure service, becomes the private IP address of the VM (or the network interface) within your VNet, rather than a public IP.

**Public Endpoint Still Exists:**

* It's crucial to understand that Service Endpoints do not remove the public IP address of the Azure service. 
    
* The service still has a public endpoint. 
    
* However, by enabling the Service Endpoint and configuring the service's firewall rules, you can restrict access to only traffic coming from your specified VNet and subnet.

**Network Security Group (NSG) Integration:**

* Service Endpoints integrate seamlessly with NSGs. 
    
* You can use NSGs on your subnets to control outbound traffic to specific Azure services using service tags. 
    
* For example, you can create an NSG rule to allow outbound traffic to the Storage service tag, ensuring that only traffic destined for Azure Storage is permitted.

**Routing Table Modification:**

* When a Service Endpoint is enabled for a subnet, Azure automatically injects a more specific route into the subnet's effective route table for the target service's public IP ranges. 
    
* This ensures that traffic to that service bypasses any custom user-defined routes (UDRs) you might have configured (e.g., forcing traffic through a network virtual appliance like a firewall) and goes directly to the service over the Azure backbone.

# Use Cases for Azure Service Endpoints:

Service Endpoints are ideal for scenarios where you need:

**Simple Network Isolation:**

* To restrict access to Azure PaaS services (e.g., Azure Storage, Azure SQL Database, Azure Key Vault, Azure Service Bus) so that they can only be accessed from specific subnets within your Azure Virtual Networks. 
    
* This is a common and effective way to enhance security without complex network configurations.

**Cost-effeciveness:**

* Service Endpoints are generally free to use, making them a budget-friendly option for securing connections within Azure.

**reducing Public Internet exposure:**

* While the service still technically has a public IP, the data traffic from your VNet does not traverse the public internet, reducing the attack surface.

**Performance Optimization:**

* By routing traffic directly over the Azure backbone, Service Endpoints offer lower latency and higher throughput compared to routing over the public internet.

**Integrating with Network Security Groups(NSGs):**

* You can use NSGs with service tags to control outbound traffic from your VNet to specific Azure services.

## Limitations and Considerations:

**Regional Scope:**

* For some services (like Azure SQL Database), the VNet and the Azure service resource must be in the same Azure region.
    
* For other services (like Azure Storage), you can secure Azure service resources to VNets in any region.

**No On-Premises Connectivity:**

* Service Endpoints do not extend private connectivity to your on-premises networks. 
    
* If you need to access Azure PaaS services privately from your on-premises data centers (connected via VPN Gateway or ExpressRoute), you should use Private Endpoints.

**Service-Wide Access:**

* When you enable a Service Endpoint for a service (e.g., Azure Storage), it applies to all instances of that service type in the region from that subnet. 
    
* While you can then use firewall rules on the individual service resource to restrict access to specific VNets/subnets, the underlying connectivity is still service-wide. 
    
* For more granular control (e.g., restricting access to a single storage account within a subnet), you might need Service Endpoint Policies (currently only available for Azure Storage).

**UDR Bypass:**

* As mentioned, Service Endpoint routes take precedence over UDRs. 
    
* This means if you have a UDR configured to force all outbound traffic through a firewall, traffic to services with enabled Service Endpoints will bypass that firewall. 
    
* This can impact your centralized logging and inspection strategies.

**DNS Resolution:**

* With Service Endpoints, DNS resolution for Azure services still resolves to their public IP addresses. 

* The private routing happens at the network layer within Azure's backbone.
