### **Module 1.8: Management & Governance Fundamentals**

Effective management and governance are essential for any cloud environment. Azure provides a suite of services to help you monitor performance, enforce policies, optimize costs, and gain insights into your cloud resources.

#### **Azure Monitor (Metrics, Logs, Alerts - High-Level)**

Azure Monitor is a comprehensive solution for collecting, analyzing, and acting on telemetry from your Azure and on-premises environments. It helps you understand how your applications and infrastructure are performing and proactively identifies issues.

* **Metrics:**
    * **Description:** Numerical values that describe an aspect of a system at a particular point in time. They are lightweight and collected at regular intervals.
    * **Purpose:** Ideal for near real-time alerting, tracking performance trends, and visualizing resource health (e.g., CPU utilization, network I/O, storage latency).
    * **Features:** Multi-dimensional, allowing you to filter and segment metrics by various properties (e.g., CPU usage by VM instance, network traffic by subnet).

* **Logs:**
    * **Description:** Records of events that occurred in your system. Logs can contain different types of data (structured or free-form text) and include a timestamp.
    * **Purpose:** Powerful for in-depth analysis, root cause analysis, auditing, and complex queries (e.g., error messages, access logs, security events).
    * **Storage:** Stored in Log Analytics Workspaces, where you can use Kusto Query Language (KQL) for powerful querying and analysis.

* **Alerts:**
    * **Description:** Notifications that fire when specific conditions are met based on metrics or logs. Alerts can proactively notify you of critical issues and trigger automated actions.
    * **Purpose:** To detect and address issues before users notice them, ensuring the availability and performance of your applications and services.
    * **Actions:** Can trigger various actions like sending emails, SMS, push notifications, or initiating automated runbooks via Azure Automation or Logic Apps.
    * **Types:** Metric alerts, log search alerts, activity log alerts (for subscription-level events), smart detection alerts, and more.

#### **Azure Policy (Introduction to Governance Policies)**

Azure Policy is a service in Azure that you use to create, assign, and manage policies that enforce rules and effects for your resources. It helps you ensure that resources within your Azure environment comply with organizational standards, cost controls, and security practices.

* **Purpose:**
    * **Enforce Standards:** Ensure consistency, compliance, and cost efficiency across your Azure environment.
    * **Audit and Remediate:** Identify non-compliant resources and, in some cases, automatically remediate them.
    * **Prevent Non-Compliance:** Block the creation or update of resources that violate your defined policies.
    * **Regulatory Compliance:** Helps meet specific regulatory and industry compliance requirements.
* **How it Works:**
    * **Policy Definitions:** Define the rules and conditions that resources must comply with (e.g., "VMs must use managed disks," "Storage accounts must be encrypted," "Only allow resources in specific regions").
    * **Initiative Definitions:** A collection of policy definitions grouped together to achieve a larger goal (e.g., "Azure Security Baseline Initiative").
    * **Assignments:** Apply a policy or initiative to a specific scope (management group, subscription, or resource group). Once assigned, Azure Policy continuously evaluates resources within that scope for compliance.
    * **Effects:** What happens when a resource violates a policy (e.g., `Deny` the creation, `Audit` for reporting, `Modify` the resource to comply, `DeployIfNotExists` to deploy a related resource).

#### **Azure Advisor (Recommendations)**

Azure Advisor is a personalized cloud consultant that helps you follow best practices to optimize your Azure deployments. It analyzes your resource configuration and usage telemetry and then recommends solutions to improve your deployments in five key areas.

* **Purpose:** To provide actionable recommendations to help you optimize and improve the reliability, security, performance, cost-effectiveness, and operational excellence of your Azure resources.
* **Recommendation Categories:**
    * **Cost:** Identifies underutilized resources (e.g., low-usage VMs), recommends right-sizing, suggests converting to reserved instances or savings plans.
    * **Security:** Integrates with Microsoft Defender for Cloud to provide recommendations on improving your security posture (e.g., enable MFA, apply security updates).
    * **Reliability (formerly High Availability):** Ensures business continuity of your critical applications (e.g., use Availability Sets, configure backup).
    * **Operational Excellence:** Helps you improve process and workflow efficiency, resource manageability, and compliance (e.g., implement tagging, enable diagnostic logs).
    * **Performance:** Recommends ways to improve the speed and responsiveness of your applications (e.g., upgrade to Premium SSD, optimize database queries).

#### **Azure Cost Management + Billing (Introduction)**

Azure Cost Management + Billing is a suite of tools that helps you understand, report on, and optimize your Azure spending. It provides detailed insights into your cloud costs, allows you to set budgets, and offers recommendations for cost savings.

* **Purpose:** To empower organizations to monitor, analyze, and optimize their cloud costs across various Azure services and subscriptions, ensuring financial accountability and preventing unexpected spending.
* **Key Capabilities:**
    * **Cost Analysis:** Provides detailed visualizations and filters to track spending across subscriptions, resource groups, services, and tags. You can view historical data and forecast future costs.
    * **Budgets:** Set custom spending thresholds for subscriptions or resource groups with automated alerts to notify you when you approach or exceed your defined limits.
    * **Alerts:** Configure various types of cost alerts (e.g., budget alerts, anomaly alerts for unexpected spikes).
    * **Recommendations:** Integrates with Azure Advisor to pull cost-saving recommendations (e.g., right-size VMs, purchase reservations).
    * **Exports:** Schedule exports of detailed cost and usage data to a storage account for deeper analysis in external tools (like Power BI).
    * **Invoicing:** View and manage your invoices, payment methods, and billing profiles.
    * **Optimisation:** Tools like Azure Reservations and Azure Savings Plans allow you to commit to specific usage for a period to get significant discounts compared to pay-as-you-go rates. Azure Hybrid Benefit allows using on-premises licenses for cost savings.
