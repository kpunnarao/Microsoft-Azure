### **➡️ Module 5.6: Introduction to Azure Database Migration Service (DMS)**

Azure Database Migration Service (DMS) is a fully managed service that enables seamless migrations from multiple database sources to Azure data platforms with minimal downtime. 

It provides a comprehensive, highly resilient, and automated approach to migrate on-premises databases to Azure, facilitating the modernization of your data estate.

#### **I. What is Azure Database Migration Service (DMS)?**

* **Purpose:** DMS is designed to simplify and accelerate database migrations to Azure. It supports various source databases (e.g., SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL) and target Azure database services (e.g., Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Managed Instance, Azure Database for MySQL/PostgreSQL/MariaDB, Azure Cosmos DB).
* **Fully Managed Service:** As a PaaS offering, Azure handles the underlying infrastructure for DMS. You provision a DMS instance, and it manages the migration process, including data replication, schema conversion (where necessary), and performance monitoring during migration.
* **Minimal Downtime:** DMS supports both offline and online migrations. For critical workloads, it provides capabilities for online migrations, where the source database remains operational during the data synchronization process, minimizing application downtime.
* **Assessment & Recommendations:** While DMS primarily handles the migration *execution*, it integrates with tools like the **Data Migration Assistant (DMA)** (for SQL Server) to assess source databases for compatibility issues with target Azure platforms and provide recommendations before migration.

#### **II. Supported Source and Target Platforms**

DMS is continuously updated to support a growing list of migration scenarios. Here are some of the most common ones:

* **Common Source Databases:**
    * SQL Server (on-premises or on VMs)
    * Oracle
    * MySQL
    * PostgreSQL
    * MariaDB
    * MongoDB (for Cosmos DB target)
    * Teradata (for Azure Synapse Analytics target)
    * SAP ASE

* **Common Target Azure Database Services:**
    * Azure SQL Database (Single DB, Elastic Pool)
    * Azure SQL Managed Instance
    * SQL Server on Azure VMs
    * Azure Database for MySQL
    * Azure Database for PostgreSQL (Single Server, Flexible Server, Hyperscale Citus)
    * Azure Database for MariaDB
    * Azure Cosmos DB (MongoDB API, SQL API)
    * Azure Synapse Analytics
    * Azure Data Lake Storage (for data warehouse migrations)

#### **III. Key Features and Benefits**

1.  **Simplified Migration Workflow:**
    * Guides you through a step-by-step process for various migration scenarios.
    * Integrates with pre-migration assessment tools.

2.  **Online vs. Offline Migrations:**
    * **Online Migrations:** The source database remains active and continues accepting transactions while data is synchronized to the Azure target. This minimizes downtime, critical for production applications. DMS keeps the two databases synchronized until you perform a cutover.
    * **Offline Migrations:** The source database must be taken offline during the data transfer. Suitable for less critical applications or scenarios where downtime is acceptable.

3.  **Heterogeneous Migrations:**
    * Supports migrations between different database types (e.g., Oracle to Azure Database for PostgreSQL, MongoDB to Azure Cosmos DB). DMS handles schema conversion and data transformation where necessary.
    * For homogeneous migrations (e.g., SQL Server to Azure SQL Database), the process is more straightforward.

4.  **Automatic Data Synchronization:**
    * For online migrations, DMS continuously synchronizes data from the source to the target, including DDL (Data Definition Language) and DML (Data Manipulation Language) changes.

5.  **Robust and Resilient:**
    * Designed for reliability, handling network interruptions and other transient issues during the migration process.

6.  **Cost-Effective:**
    * The service itself is a PaaS offering, and you pay for the compute resources consumed by the migration service. The ability to perform online migrations helps reduce business impact costs.

7.  **Migration Monitoring:**
    * Provides detailed monitoring of the migration progress, including data transfer rates, remaining time, and any errors.

#### **IV. Typical Migration Workflow using DMS**

While the exact steps vary slightly depending on the source and target, a general workflow for an online migration using DMS looks like this:

1.  **Pre-migration Assessment (Outside DMS):**
    * **Analyze Source Database:** Use tools like **Data Migration Assistant (DMA)** for SQL Server or **AWS Schema Conversion Tool (SCT)** for heterogeneous migrations (e.g., Oracle, MySQL to PostgreSQL) to identify compatibility issues, assess complexity, and get recommendations for schema conversion.
    * **Schema Migration:** If migrating between different database types (e.g., Oracle to PostgreSQL), you typically use the assessment tool to generate the schema for the target, then apply it manually or via the tool to the Azure target.

2.  **Provision Azure Database Migration Service Instance:**
    * In the Azure portal, create a new Azure Database Migration Service resource.
    * Ensure the DMS instance has network connectivity to both your source database (on-premises or in another cloud) and your target Azure database. This usually involves VPN Gateway, ExpressRoute, or VNet peering.

3.  **Create a New Migration Project:**
    * Within the DMS instance, create a new migration project.
    * **Select Source and Target Server Types:** Choose your source and target database platforms (e.g., SQL Server to Azure SQL Managed Instance).
    * **Select Migration Type:** Choose **Online data migration** (recommended for production) or **Offline data migration**.

4.  **Specify Source and Target Connection Details:**
    * Provide connection strings, credentials, and network details for your source and target databases.

5.  **Select Databases/Tables for Migration:**
    * Choose which databases, schemas, or tables you want to migrate.

6.  **Configure Migration Settings:**
    * Set up data synchronization options, including any data transformations if applicable.
    * For online migrations, this involves setting up initial full load and then continuous data replication.

7.  **Start the Migration:**
    * Initiate the migration task. DMS will perform an initial full load of data and then begin continuous synchronization (for online migrations).

8.  **Monitor Migration Progress:**
    * Track the migration status through the Azure portal or DMS APIs. Address any errors or warnings.

9.  **Perform Cutover (for Online Migrations):**
    * Once the target database is fully synchronized and you've verified data consistency:
        * Stop inbound transactions to the source database (briefly).
        * Perform a final synchronization (if necessary).
        * Change your application's connection strings to point to the new Azure target database.
        * Complete the migration in DMS, which stops the synchronization.
    * This cutover window is typically very short, minimizing downtime.

10. **Post-Migration Validation & Optimization:**
    * Thoroughly test your application with the new Azure database.
    * Monitor performance, security, and optimize as needed (e.g., indexing, query tuning).
    * Decommission the old source database.
