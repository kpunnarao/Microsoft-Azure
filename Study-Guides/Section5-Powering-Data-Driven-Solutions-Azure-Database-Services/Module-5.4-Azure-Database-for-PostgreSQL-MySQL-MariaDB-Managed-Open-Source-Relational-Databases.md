### **üêò Module 4.9: Azure Database for PostgreSQL, MySQL, & MariaDB - Managed Open-Source Relational Databases**

Azure offers fully managed services for popular open-source relational database engines: PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MariaDB. These services provide the benefits of a robust, community-driven database combined with the scalability, high availability, security, and reduced management overhead of Azure's Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) model.

#### **I. What are Azure Database for PostgreSQL, MySQL, & MariaDB?**

These services provide a managed relational database service for application developers. Azure takes care of the underlying infrastructure, operating system, and database engine, including patching, backups, scaling, and security. This allows you to focus on application development without worrying about database administration tasks.

* **Key Shared Benefits:**
    * **Fully Managed PaaS:** Automates patching, backups, high availability, and security.
    * **Scalability:** Easily scale compute and storage independently.
    * **High Availability:** Built-in HA ensures continuity of operations.
    * **Security:** Comprehensive security features including network isolation, encryption, and threat protection.
    * **Cost-Effectiveness:** Pay-as-you-go pricing, with options for reserved capacity and burstable tiers for cost optimization.
    * **Open-Source Compatibility:** Maintain compatibility with tools, drivers, and frameworks designed for their respective open-source communities.
    * **Migration Tools:** Tools like Azure Database Migration Service simplify moving existing databases to Azure.

#### **II. Deployment Options: Single Server vs. Flexible Server**

For **Azure Database for PostgreSQL** and **Azure Database for MySQL**, there are two primary deployment options that offer different levels of control and capabilities:

1.  **Single Server (Legacy/Simpler Workloads):**
    * **Architecture:** Optimized for single-server architecture, typically deployed on a single VM.
    * **High Availability:** Provides 99.99% SLA. Achieves HA through automatic failover to a hot standby in the same data center. This involves redeploying the database service, which can incur a few minutes of downtime.
    * **Networking:** Primarily relies on public endpoints with firewall rules, or VNet Service Endpoints.
    * **Features:** Simpler, fixed configuration.
    * **Cost:** Generally lower cost for basic workloads.
    * **Use Cases:** Simpler applications, dev/test, or existing applications that require minimal configuration. **Generally not recommended for new production deployments.**

2.  **Flexible Server (Recommended for New Production Workloads):**
    * **Architecture:** Provides more granular control and a more robust architecture, typically deployed across Availability Zones within a region.
    * **High Availability:** Offers **zone-redundant high availability** for greater resilience (99.99% SLA). It uses a hot standby server in a different availability zone, with synchronous replication. Failovers are typically much faster (seconds to tens of seconds) than Single Server. It also supports **same-zone HA** (hot standby in the same zone).
    * **Networking:** Supports **VNet integration** (Private Link) for enhanced security, enabling private and secure access from within your Azure Virtual Network. This is a significant advantage over Single Server for production deployments.
    * **Features:**
        * **Burstable Compute Tier:** Cost-effective option for workloads with intermittent, non-critical CPU activity.
        * **Custom Maintenance Window:** Allows you to schedule patching and updates during specific times.
        * **Zone Redundancy:** Deploy your primary and standby servers across different Availability Zones.
        * **Restart Server:** Ability to restart the server manually.
        * **More flexible configurations** for database parameters.
    * **Cost:** Offers a more flexible pricing model, including burstable compute.
    * **Use Cases:** Production workloads requiring higher availability, lower latency, custom maintenance windows, and VNet integration. Most recommended for new applications.

**Azure Database for MariaDB** currently only offers the **Single Server** deployment option.

#### **III. Service Tiers and Scalability**

Both Single Server and Flexible Server (for PostgreSQL/MySQL) offer various pricing tiers and scaling options:

* **Burstable (Flexible Server only for PostgreSQL/MySQL):**
    * Ideal for small, low-cost workloads that don't need continuous full CPU capacity. CPU credits accumulate during low-usage periods and can be used for bursts during peak times.
* **General Purpose:**
    * Balanced compute and memory, suitable for most business applications. Uses remote storage.
* **Memory Optimized:**
    * Higher memory-to-vCore ratio, ideal for high-performance database workloads requiring in-memory processing. Uses remote storage.

* **Scalability:** You can scale compute (vCores) and storage (GB) independently, both up and down, to match your application's evolving needs.

#### **IV. High Availability and Disaster Recovery (HA/DR)**

* **Built-in HA:**
    * **Single Server:** Automatic failover to a healthy standby within the same data center.
    * **Flexible Server:** Zone-redundant (primary and standby in different AZs) or same-zone HA (primary and standby in same AZ). Synchronous replication ensures no data loss on failover.
* **Automated Backups:**
    * Automatic full, differential, and transaction log backups.
    * Stored in geo-redundant storage (GRS) by default (can choose LRS).
    * Point-in-time restore within the configured retention period (up to 35 days for most, up to 90 days for Flexible Server).
* **Read Replicas:**
    * Allows you to offload read-intensive workloads from your primary database to read-only replicas in the same or different regions.
    * Asynchronously replicated from the primary.
    * Improve read performance and scale for read-heavy applications.
    * Useful for reporting, analytics, and serving global reads with lower latency.
* **Geo-Redundant Backup/Restore (Cross-Region DR):**
    * Leverages geo-redundant backups to enable restoring your database to any Azure region in the event of a regional disaster.
    * RPO is typically up to 1 hour, RTO depends on database size (hours).
* **Manual Cross-Region Disaster Recovery:** For Flexible Server, you can use read replicas in another region and manually fail over to them in a disaster scenario for better RTO/RPO than geo-restore.

#### **V. Security Features**

All three services inherit robust security features from Azure:

* **Network Isolation:**
    * **Firewall Rules:** Limit access to specified IP addresses or ranges.
    * **VNet Service Endpoints (Single Server):** Extend your VNet's private address space and identity to the Azure services over a direct connection.
    * **Private Link (Flexible Server & Single Server):** Provides private and secure access to your database via a private IP address within your VNet, completely removing exposure to the public internet. This is generally the most recommended and secure approach.
* **Authentication:**
    * **SQL Authentication:** Traditional username and password.
    * **Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) Authentication (PostgreSQL/MySQL):** Recommended for centralized identity management, enabling single sign-on and MFA.
* **Encryption:**
    * **Encryption at Rest (Transparent Data Encryption - TDE):** Data and backups are encrypted using Microsoft-managed keys by default. Customer-managed keys (CMK) from Azure Key Vault are also supported.
    * **Encryption in Transit:** All connections use SSL/TLS by default.
* **Threat Protection (Advanced Threat Protection):**
    * Detects anomalous activities indicating potential threats to your database.
    * Provides security alerts and recommendations.
* **Auditing:** Logs database events to an Azure Storage account or Log Analytics workspace for compliance and forensic analysis.

#### **VI. Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Hyperscale (Citus)**

This is a unique deployment option for PostgreSQL, specifically designed for highly scalable, distributed relational databases.

* **What it is:** A horizontally scalable database solution for PostgreSQL powered by the Citus extension. It enables sharding (distributing) your data across multiple PostgreSQL nodes.
* **Architecture:**
    * **Coordinator Node:** Handles incoming queries, distributes them to worker nodes, and aggregates results.
    * **Worker Nodes:** Store sharded data and perform computations in parallel.
* **Key Features:**
    * **Massive Scalability:** Scale out compute and storage by adding more worker nodes, enabling support for large datasets and high-concurrency workloads beyond what a single PostgreSQL server can handle.
    * **Parallel Query Processing:** Queries are parallelized across worker nodes for faster execution.
    * **Distributed Tables:** You define how tables are distributed across nodes (e.g., hash distribution for join performance, reference tables for common lookups).
    * **PostgreSQL Compatibility:** Retains full PostgreSQL compatibility, allowing you to use existing tools and extensions.
    * **Built-in HA:** Automatically replicates data to multiple nodes within a cluster for high availability.
* **Use Cases:**
    * **Large-Scale Multi-tenant SaaS:** Sharding tenant data across nodes.
    * **Real-time Analytics:** Ingesting and querying large volumes of time-series data.
    * **High-Throughput OLTP:** Applications with extremely high transaction rates that can benefit from horizontal scaling.
    * **Any workload requiring distributed PostgreSQL.**
