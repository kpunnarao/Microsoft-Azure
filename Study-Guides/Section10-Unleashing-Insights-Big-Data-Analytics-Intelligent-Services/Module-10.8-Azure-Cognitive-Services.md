            * **Sentiment Analysis:** Determine the emotional tone (positive, negative, neutral) of text.
            * **Key Phrase Extraction:** Identify important concepts and phrases in text.
            * **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Identify and categorize entities like people, places, organizations, and dates.
            * **Language Detection:** Identify the language of input text.
            * **Conversational Language Understanding (CLU):** Understand user intent and extract entities from conversational speech or text (often used in chatbots).
            * **Question Answering (formerly QnA Maker):** Build a knowledge base to answer user questions based on provided text (e.g., FAQs).
            * **Summarization:** Condense documents or conversations into key points.
        * **Translator:** Translate text between over 100 languages.
        * **Azure OpenAI Service:** While a standalone service, it's often grouped with Cognitive Services due to its API-driven access to large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4, GPT-3.5 Turbo, and DALL-E for content generation, summarization, code generation, and more. It offers powerful generative AI capabilities.
    * **Use Cases:** Chatbots and virtual assistants, customer feedback analysis, content moderation, multilingual communication, content creation, semantic search.

4.  **Decision:**
    * **Purpose:** Enable applications to make smart decisions and recommendations based on real-time data.
