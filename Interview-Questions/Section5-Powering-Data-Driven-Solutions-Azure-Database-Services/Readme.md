# üóÑÔ∏è Section 5: Powering Data-Driven Solutions - Interview Questions

## Preparing for Your Azure Cloud Interview - Database Services

Welcome to the **Interview Questions** for Section 5: Powering Data-Driven Solutions! This module focuses on Azure's comprehensive suite of managed database services. As an Azure Solutions Architect, you'll be responsible for recommending, designing, and optimizing data persistence layers, which involves choosing the right database for the right workload, ensuring scalability, high availability, and security.

These questions are designed to test your understanding of relational databases (Azure SQL, Managed Instance, Open-Source), NoSQL databases (Cosmos DB), caching solutions (Azure Cache for Redis), and fundamental migration concepts. Practicing these will enable you to confidently discuss database architectural patterns, performance considerations, and data migration strategies in an interview setting.

### What These Interview Questions Will Cover:

The questions in this section are designed to test your understanding of:

1.  **Azure SQL Database Ecosystem:**
    * Differentiate between **Azure SQL Database (PaaS)**, **Azure SQL Managed Instance (PaaS)**, and **SQL Server on Azure VM (IaaS)**. When would you recommend each for a migration scenario?
    * Explain the concept of **DTU** and **vCore**-based purchasing models for Azure SQL Database. When would you choose one over the other?
    * What are **Elastic Pools** in Azure SQL Database? What problem do they solve?
    * How do you ensure high availability and disaster recovery for Azure SQL Database? (e.g., Geo-replication, Failover Groups)
    * What is **Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)** in Azure SQL Database?
2.  **Azure Cosmos DB - Global Scale NoSQL:**
    * What is Azure Cosmos DB, and what are its key characteristics (e.g., global distribution, multi-model, guaranteed latency)?
    * Explain the different **Consistency Levels** in Azure Cosmos DB (Strong, Bounded Staleness, Session, Consistent Prefix, Eventual). When would you use each, and what are the trade-offs?
    * What is a **Request Unit (RU)** in Cosmos DB? How is it used for provisioning throughput?
    * What is the importance of a well-chosen **Partition Key** in Azure Cosmos DB? What happens if you choose a poor one?
    * Name the different **APIs** supported by Azure Cosmos DB (e.g., Core (SQL), MongoDB, Cassandra, Gremlin, Table). When would you use a specific API?
    * How does Cosmos DB ensure high availability and disaster recovery across multiple regions?
3.  **Managed Open-Source Databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB):**
    * Differentiate between **Azure Database for PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MariaDB**. When would you choose one over the others?
    * Explain the concept of **Flexible Server** for Azure Database for PostgreSQL/MySQL. What benefits does it offer over Single Server?
    * How do you ensure high availability and read scalability for these managed open-source databases? (e.g., HA architecture, Read Replicas)
    * What are some common use cases for managed open-source databases in Azure?
4.  **Azure Cache for Redis:**
    * What is Azure Cache for Redis, and what problem does it primarily solve?
    * What are the benefits of using an in-memory data store like Redis for applications?
    * Describe common **use cases** for Azure Cache for Redis (e.g., session store, leaderboards, message broker).
    * What are the different **pricing tiers** for Azure Cache for Redis, and what features do they offer?
5.  **Database Migration Considerations:**
    * What are the common **migration strategies** for moving databases to Azure? (e.g., Lift & Shift, Replatform, Re-architect)
    * What is **Azure Database Migration Service (DMS)**, and how does it facilitate database migrations?
    * What are some key factors to consider when planning a database migration to Azure? (e.g., compatibility, downtime, data integrity, connectivity, security)
    * Explain the concept of **online vs. offline migration** for databases.

### How to Use These Questions for Interview Preparation:

* **Scenario-Based Responses:** Many database questions are best answered by providing specific scenarios and explaining *why* a particular database service or configuration is the best fit.
* **Performance & Scalability:** For each database, be ready to discuss how it scales (vertically/horizontally), handles high throughput, and ensures low latency.
* **HA/DR:** Always consider and explain the high availability and disaster recovery options for each database service.
* **Security Features:** Be prepared to discuss how each database service offers security capabilities (encryption, network isolation, access control).
* **Trade-offs:** Articulate the pros and cons (cost, management overhead, flexibility, compatibility) of different database choices.

Mastering these database questions will demonstrate your ability to design robust, scalable, and secure data solutions, which is a core competency for any Azure Solutions Architect. Good luck!
