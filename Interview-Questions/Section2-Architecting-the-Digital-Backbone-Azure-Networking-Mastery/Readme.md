# üåê Section 2: Architecting the Digital Backbone - Interview Questions

## Preparing for Your Azure Cloud Interview - Networking Mastery

Welcome to the **Interview Questions** for Section 2: Architecting the Digital Backbone! Networking is often considered the foundation of any cloud deployment, and interviewers frequently delve deep into an architect's understanding of network design, security, and connectivity within Azure.

These questions are designed to challenge your comprehension of Azure Virtual Networks, security controls, routing, connectivity options, and traffic management services. Practicing these will not only ensure you grasp the technical details but also enable you to confidently discuss design choices and troubleshoot network-related scenarios.

### What These Interview Questions Will Cover:

The questions in this section are designed to test your understanding of:

1.  **Azure Virtual Networks (VNets) & Subnets:**
    * What is an Azure Virtual Network (VNet), and why is it fundamental to Azure deployments?
    * Explain the purpose of subnets within a VNet. How do you determine appropriate subnet sizing?
    * What is the CIDR notation, and how is it used in Azure networking?
    * Can two VNets have overlapping IP address spaces? What are the implications?
2.  **Network Security & Isolation:**
    * What is a Network Security Group (NSG)? How does it control traffic, and what is the order of rule processing?
    * Differentiate between applying an NSG to a subnet versus a Network Interface (NIC). When would you choose one over the other?
    * What are Application Security Groups (ASGs), and how do they simplify NSG management?
    * Explain Azure Firewall. How does it differ from an NSG, and when would you use it?
    * What are Virtual Network Service Endpoints and Azure Private Link? Why are they important for securing access to PaaS services?
3.  **VNet Connectivity & Routing:**
    * What is VNet Peering? What are its limitations (e.g., transitive routing)?
    * How can you connect an on-premises network to Azure? Differentiate between Azure VPN Gateway (Site-to-Site) and Azure ExpressRoute.
    * When would you recommend ExpressRoute over a Site-to-Site VPN, and vice versa?
    * Explain User-Defined Routes (UDRs) and their purpose. When would you use them with a Network Virtual Appliance (NVA)?
    * What is forced tunneling in Azure networking?
4.  **Traffic Management & Load Balancing:**
    * Differentiate between Azure Load Balancer (Layer 4) and Azure Application Gateway (Layer 7). When would you use each?
    * What is a Public IP address in Azure? Differentiate between Basic and Standard SKUs for Public IPs.
    * Explain Azure Front Door. How does it differ from Application Gateway, and what are its key use cases?
    * What is Azure Traffic Manager? How does it differ from Load Balancer/Application Gateway?
5.  **Azure DNS:**
    * What is Azure DNS, and how does it support domain name resolution?
    * Differentiate between Public DNS Zones and Private DNS Zones.
    * How would you configure a custom domain name for an Azure Web App using Azure DNS?
6.  **Network Monitoring & Troubleshooting:**
    * What is Azure Network Watcher? Name some of its capabilities.
    * How would you troubleshoot connectivity issues between two VMs in different subnets or VNets?

### How to Use These Questions for Interview Preparation:

* **Scenario-Based Thinking:** For design-related questions (e.g., "How would you connect X to Y?"), outline the steps, services, and considerations (security, cost, performance).
* **Draw Diagrams (Mentally or Physically):** Visualizing network topologies helps in articulating complex answers.
* **Explain "Why":** Don't just list services; explain *why* you would choose a particular service or configuration over another.
* **Discuss Trade-offs:** Be prepared to discuss the pros and cons (cost, complexity, performance, scalability) of different networking options.
* **Stay Updated:** Networking services in Azure evolve. Be aware of the latest features and best practices.

Mastering these networking questions will demonstrate your ability to design the critical backbone of any scalable, secure, and performant cloud solution in Azure. Good luck!
