## Preparing for Your Azure Cloud Interview - Compute & Application Platforms

Welcome to the **Interview Questions** for Section 3: Powering Your Solutions! This module focuses on Azure's diverse compute and application hosting platforms. As an Azure Solutions Architect, you'll constantly face decisions about where and how to run applications â€“ from traditional virtual machines to modern serverless functions and containers.

These questions are designed to test your understanding of IaaS, PaaS, and FaaS compute models, their capabilities, use cases, and underlying architectural considerations. Practicing these will enable you to confidently discuss the trade-offs and best practices for hosting various workloads in Azure.

### What These Interview Questions Will Cover:

The questions in this section are designed to test your understanding of:

1.  **Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) - IaaS:**
    * When would you choose an Azure Virtual Machine over a PaaS service like Azure App Service?
    * Explain the concept of Azure **Availability Sets** and **Availability Zones**. How do they differ, and when would you use each for VM high availability?
    * What is the purpose of a **Virtual Machine Scale Set (VMSS)**? How does it help with scalability?
    * Differentiate between OS disks and data disks for Azure VMs. What are the recommended storage types for each?
    * How do you ensure a VM is updated and patched regularly in Azure?
    * What is the role of an Azure **Ephemeral OS disk**?
2.  **Azure App Service - PaaS Web Hosting:**
    * What is Azure App Service, and what types of applications can it host?
    * Explain the concept of an **App Service Plan**. What factors influence its cost and performance?
    * What are **Deployment Slots** in App Service, and how do they aid in safe deployments?
    * How would you ensure high availability and scalability for an Azure App Service application?
    * What are some common methods for deploying code to Azure App Service?
    * How does custom domain mapping work with Azure App Service?
3.  **Container Services - Azure Container Instances (ACI) & Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS):**
    * What is containerization, and what are its benefits?
    * Differentiate between **Azure Container Instances (ACI)** and **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**. When would you choose one over the other?
    * What is **Azure Container Registry (ACR)**, and why is it important for containerized applications?
    * Explain the core components of an AKS cluster (e.g., control plane, nodes, pods, deployments, services).
    * How does AKS provide scalability and self-healing capabilities?
    * What is a sidecar container pattern in Kubernetes?
4.  **Serverless Computing - Azure Functions:**
    * What is **serverless computing**, and what are the key benefits of Azure Functions?
    * Differentiate between HTTP-triggered and timer-triggered Azure Functions. Name other common triggers.
    * Explain the concept of **bindings** in Azure Functions (input and output).
    * What is the difference between a Consumption Plan and an App Service Plan for Azure Functions hosting? When would you choose each?
    * How do you ensure scalability for Azure Functions during peak loads?
5.  **Other Compute Considerations:**
    * What are some considerations for choosing between Windows and Linux VMs in Azure?
    * How would you decide between IaaS, PaaS, or Serverless for a new application workload? Provide a scenario for each.
    * What is the purpose of **Azure Batch**?

### How to Use These Questions for Interview Preparation:

* **Compare & Contrast:** Many questions ask you to differentiate between services. Be clear about their unique selling points, use cases, and underlying models (IaaS, PaaS, FaaS).
* **Discuss Scaling & HA:** For each service, be ready to explain how it achieves scalability and high availability.
* **Provide Use Cases:** Illustrate your understanding by giving practical scenarios where each service would be the optimal choice.
* **Consider Trade-offs:** Discuss the pros and cons (cost, control, management overhead, flexibility) associated with different compute options.
* **Security Implications:** Briefly touch upon how security is managed for each compute type (e.g., NSGs for VMs, Managed Identities for App Service).

Mastering these compute-related questions will demonstrate your ability to design the fundamental application hosting layer for any solution in Azure, selecting the most appropriate platform for specific needs. Good luck!
